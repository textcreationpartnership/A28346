            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LADIES <hi>Charity School-houſe Roll</hi> OF HIGHGATE: OR A Subſcription of many Noble, well-diſpoſed Ladies for the eaſie carrying of it on.</head>
            <p>BEing well informed that there is a Pious, Good, Commendable Work for maintaining near forty Poor, or Fatherleſs Children, Born all at, or near <hi>Highgate, Hornſey,</hi> or <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted:</hi> We whoſe Names are ſubſcribed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52502:4"/> do engage or promiſe, That if the ſaid Boys are decently Cloathed in Blew, lined with Yellow; conſtantly fed all alike with good and wholſom Diet; taught to Read, Write, and Caſt Accompts, and ſo put out to Trades, in order to Live another day; Then we will give for one Year, two or three (if we well like the deſign, and prudent management of it) once a Year, the ſum below mentioned: But if we be not fully ſatisfied, that the ſaid Boys are all of them true Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Charity, or are in the leaſt neglected to be taught the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and Fear of God by good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, frequent Catechizing, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly going to the Publick Church every Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Day, Forenoon and After; then we will not mind this our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the leaſt, or contribute any thing at all to it: But hoping that the work may be good, take Root, find many friends, laſt long, be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in future Ages, we be enclined to do as above mentioned, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52502:4"/> but that a Kernel may become a Tree, and a thing of ſmall beginning prove popular and praiſe-worthy to the Honour of our Proteſtant Religion, and in time find many Benefactors: Alſo it ſtanding ſo exceeding well and near this City's famous Hoſpitals, which were not half ſo great as now. However, this little Infant being the firſt erected thing in our names, and Dedicated to us as a Pious Work, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Encouragement; we are not willing it ſhould wholly die, but to try the Expedient, believing all good Works to be good, and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, in Life, Death or Eternity, but the ſureſt ſign of true love to God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now 'tis ten to one but ſome of your near Acquaintance, as well as your great Relations, may ſay, <hi>Pray Madam let us trouble you with a ſmall ſum, or a few Guynies to this good Work, hoping it will be no ſin to add a little Charity to your Ladiſhip.</hi> And in ſuch a caſe you may for the eaſe of your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52502:5"/> memory, ſet it down in one of theſe Lines below, and ſo you will be ſure not to forget or wrong us. Now a Lord or Gentleman's money will do almoſt as well for our School as your Ladiſhips, only we will ſtill aſcribe all to your Honour.</p>
            <p>For God's ſake do not object any thing, but read and ſee whether theſe Scriptures do not all ſeem to be for us:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The night comes when none can work</hi> (that is, at Death) <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lay up Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 6. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Make ye friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that when ye fail</hi> (that is, when ye depart this world) <hi>Chriſt may receive ye into his everlaſting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</hi> Luk. 16. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that obſerves the wind ſhall not ſow, or he that regardeth the clouds</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52502:5"/> 
               <hi>ſhall not reap,</hi> (that is, he that makes excuſes and objections) <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But caſt your Bread upon the waters, and after many days you ſhall find it,</hi> Eccl. 11. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given to you,</hi> Luke 16: 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they do good, and not truſt in uncertain riches, but be rich in good works,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the Poor; the Lord ſhall preſerve him alive, when he lay ſick; and not deliver him into his enemies hands, but he ſhall be bleſſed in the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 41. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>And now he that gives in Life, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Lanthorn before him, &amp; makes his own hands and eyes Executors.</p>
            <p>The Great Ladies do allow their Houſe-keeper one bottle of Wine, three of Ale, half a dozen Rolls, and two Diſhes of Meat a day, who is to ſee the Wilderneſs, Orchard, great Proſpect, Walks and Gardens, all well
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52502:6"/> kept and Rolled for their Honour's Families, and to give them ſmall Treats according to diſcretion, when they pleaſe to take the Air, which is undoubtedly the beſt round <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three or four ſhort Reaſons why you Noble Ladies ſhould not let this little School-houſe die:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is but little yet you have done for Chriſt, or the Honour of Religion, being cumbred with many things, like</hi> Martha, <hi>you neglect the beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In this you imitate the beſt two Princes that ever Reigned in this Realm, Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth, who founded moſt of the great Hoſpitals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe hated Popery, made Chriſt's Righteouſneſs her Rock, loved the Parliament, City and Dutch (a Cord hardly to be broken.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It ſtands ſo well, and is really dedicated to you who are the choiceſt Flowers in Nature:</hi> What is beloved like you Engliſh Ladies? no mortals
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52502:6"/> more happy, if ſin do not hurt you. Others have not the hand and purſe. Others have not the Climate. Others have not ſuch Husbands as your Right Engliſh Nobles are, or were many of them heretofore. No ſuch Noble Seats as moſt of yours be. You have every one a <hi>Canaan,</hi> Milk, Honey, and the holy Goſpel preacht; and may that ever be, and your lives exemplary, whilſt the Sun, Moon and Stars endure.</p>
            <p>But pray Madams, why ſhould Old <hi>Sutton</hi>'s brave <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> ſuch and ſuch Hoſpitals flouriſh, but yours die; yours who are certainly the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ladies in the whole world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May God Almighty bend your hearts to us Poor Boys, who will ever pray for you and all yours.</hi>

               <hi>An Eſſay, or humble Gueſs how the Noble Ladies may be enclined to give to, and Encourage their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity-School at</hi> Highgate, <hi>near</hi> London.</head>
            <p>AND firſt, my Lady ſuch a one cryed, Come, we will make one Purſe out of our Family, and if we get ſo much we will buy a Cloſe, Mead, or Field, near the School, and it ſhall be called by our names to the worlds end: A Noble Motion.</p>
            <p>My Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She would give for one Year or two, but ſettle nothing.</p>
            <p>And my Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She would give only to the Lecture, which is every Lord's Day, Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, about five or ſix in the Evening.</p>
            <p>But my Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She would firſt inform her ſelf, and then do as others did.</p>
            <p>My Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52502:7"/> would give at preſent, becauſe ſhe liked the School-houſe Orders, and its ſtanding very well, and was very much taken with the Wilderneſs and Walks.</p>
            <p>And my Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She would give for the fancy of the Roll, and Charity-ſtick, and that ſhe never ſaw the like, and did wonder how any body would ſpeak againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it.</p>
            <p>My Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She would give, to bind ſome out, or ſend one or two to be Poor Scholars in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> or elſe to a Sea Captain, to learn Navigation, and get her Lord (if ſhe could) to give the Quit-Rent of one or two Houſes yearly; ſaying, It was no more than the Hawks-man coſt him, or elſe ſhe would ſpare one Point of <hi>Venice,</hi> but the thing ſhould go forward: Another Lady <hi>Warwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the ſix or ſeven Citizens Ladies we intend to go to, we do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe they will give pretty well, becauſe they are the chiefeſt in all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52502:8"/> 
               <hi>London,</hi> and eminently good.</p>
            <p>My Lady ſuch a one cryed, By her Troth ſhe would give nothing at all, for ſhe had waies enough for her mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney; But the next ſaid, She would give ſo much for five or ſix ſtone of Beef every Week; and which of theſe is moſt like to Repent when they come to die and go into another World?</p>
            <p>Then my Lady ſuch a one ſaid, She would give for Bread and Beer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and <hi>January</hi> come Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, and others promiſe for their Cloathing.</p>
            <p>But we have abundance of waies and objects for our Charity: Ay, ſaid a fine young Lady, it is the better for us, we have abundance of Maſſes, many Joints, Toes, Feet, Fingers, (ſome Excuſes) all ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in order to another World, where we muſt be for ever; 'tis good to ſend a little before-hand; Faith laies out for Chriſt, and up for ſelf; but builds not upon works in the leaſt, (that is) Hay, Sand, Straw, Stubble;

Oh Madam! be not yet weary of well doing, for you will certainly reap to Eternity, what you ſow from faith, in Chriſt, love to, and union with him; and may your union with him be more inſeparable, as it is than your Arm to your Shoulder, o'
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52502:22"/> your Soul to your Body; yea, theſe are not ſo inſeparable, as both are to Chriſt; for though Time, Sin or Death may ſeparate them for a while; yet Sin, Death, Grave nor Eternity, ſhall ever ſeparate either from Chriſt; but becauſe he lives, both ſhall live, and be where he is; and what a little while is it that you have more to work for God, Chriſt, Heaven, and Eternal Happineſs? Oh! when thoſe Everlaſting Manſions are really thought on, it makes our Souls mount as the Lark, our Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, like the wing and tongue of that nimble morning Bird, to praiſe its Maker. Madam, we write not theſe things in the leaſt to ſtir up kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us; you have enough, and have done enough, more than any; for you really gave firſt of all, and we doubt not in the leaſt, now our Year is up, but many Noble well-diſpoſed perſons will follow your good Example, and ſome of your great Relate us, if you but give a little

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52502:33"/> and ſomething or another ſtill at hand to turn us where we cannot turn; namely, Coffin, Grave, Priſon, and the Winding-ſheet, or laſt ſhift, which may be eaten, but never ſhaken off by mortals; No, Skin, Fleſh, Bones, and the faggs of pale Beauty, muſt all be Earth, and turn to that from whence we firſt of all came; and 'tis but juſt and reaſonable, that as that did feed, cloath and nouriſh us, as it were our Mother for a while, we ſhould ſink, dye, fall, and lay down our heads again, into that moſt natural Lap or Boſom, as being its moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to take our laſt or longeſt ſleep in: But, O Madam! may you, yours, or Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> never come, go into one world and another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great Errand: And may the Great God direct us what it is he ſent us hither for: For this end was I born, every one ſays, namely, to know God, and live to him. Chriſt was born to die for us, as he told <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and we are bound to live to him,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52502:34"/> and muſt, or elſe we ſhall wiſh we had never been. The world is nothing but the world, a dream and ſhadow that muſt paſs away: Were the Sands; Sea and Mountains beaten Gold; Death ſtretcheth out the fingers, and we let go again all that head, hand, will, heart or thoughts, could ever hold, wiſh, or eye ſee: May you then know, may you then love Chriſt, and live to him, whilſt you may; he is yet near and dear, but you would both be loſt for ever, if you ſhould neglect him till it be too late. Chriſt once wept, often bled and wept too; but will dye no more, nor do no more for us, if we do not live to him: O let's live to him, and die to ſin, before we die: Sin dies, and dips the Soul in black and bloody Scarlets of defiance. Old, long and great ones eat it quite up. O let not Canker, Death, Hell's Worm ſpoil ſo great a Gem and Jewel, or Immortal thing! Chriſt will ſave us now; Chriſt will ſave us ever, if we be but willing; yet he will never
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52502:34"/> bleed more; but he prays and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates for us ſtill; for, <hi>he makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Interceſſion, Rom.</hi> 10. 4. and his blood ſpeaks better things than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> that cryed down ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon <hi>Cain;</hi> but Chriſt's blood crys up forgiveneſs unto us. Oh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! let them come to me if they will be mine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. And may you both dwell with him for ever; but oh! live a little if you have not; live to him a little, if you cannot much, time being now ſhort; lay up, as much as can be, Treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where no Ruſt nor Thieves can come. Lands, Debts, Rents and Houſes may be all loſt; but Treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can never miſcarry; and if ever we indeed mean to come there, it muſt be by faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Money will not buy Pardon, Blood nor Tears cannot; nor the Fruit of our Bodies go for the ſin of our Souls, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 7.

Now if this little Deſign of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52502:45"/> theirs at <hi>Highgate</hi> be for, or look like any thing of ſerving him, why ſhould it dye? Let the vanity and things of the world, ſin, folly and emptineſs dye; but let Virtue, Religion, and the Love of Charity live in all our boſoms, breaſts and lives. If Angels were to be viſible, and preſent with us, how much would they be to be embraced and deſired for their holineſs? When Great and Noble Perſons, Lords, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and others, embrace true Piety, they ſeem to imitate the holy Angels, though cloathed with frailty and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; immortality is for another world, and in that world nothing but Divine Love ſhall live: Joy and Glory ceaſe here, but that which is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall never ceaſe; yet Charity ſhall ceaſe, though it be greater than Faith and Love too. So ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>Now abides Faith, Hope and Charity, but the greateſt of all is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will you abound a little in this Work? you have enough of this world;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52502:45"/> yea, enough to ſwallow and drown you to Eternity, if a good God do not love and ſave you from the ſnares, cares and flatteries of it: For all its pleaſures are bewitching things; and the ſweeteſt Muſick fails &amp; tires often times. <hi>But thou O Son, Saint and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>fly theſe things, and Covetouſneſs.

I have done it, I have done it, ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> and there <hi>is laid up for me a Crown of Life;</hi> and that is Life indeed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>Temporal Life flies away, but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life never ends; and Charity leads to that under Chriſt: Oh! let's not want that which leads to him, who is all, and will be all for ever, <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 11. Other things will fail, but Chriſt will never fail, if we be his, and he ours. Oh! get a never-failing Chriſt to be your God and Guide, Lord and Maſter now. If all the Princes, Kings and Queens in the world had but one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52502:46"/> Lord and Maſter, as they have not in a ſtrict ſenſe, to whom Account at laſt muſt be given; would they, or ſhould they not love him? I am ſure all the Ladies in the world have but one Lord at laſt to truſt to; Oh! love him now, that he may love you in a dying hour, and ſave you then when you and the world muſt part; and part you muſt for ever; but then to be for ever with the Lord of Lords, the Lord of Life and Glory, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>And where he is, to be alſo there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his laſt prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. Oh! how happy will that be? and may this happineſs be the portion of your Honour, and all your Honour's ſweet and lovely Children too; but that can never be, unleſs you love and live to him, embrace and chuſe him as the Chiefeſt Good. Be wiſe then, O ye Honourable of the Earth, Lords, Ladies, and others! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>If ye were a thouſand times more Noble, Rich and Bountiful than ye are, yet, yet, you will all certainly periſh
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52502:46"/> if you do not ſtoop, if you do not bend to him, to whom every knee muſt bend, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. what will become of you, Lords, Ladies and others? you have but one true friend in Heaven and Earth, and that is the good God, and our good Lord Jeſus; and if ye do whatſoever he has bid you, he will love you to the end of Time and Eternity too, if that could be ſuppoſed to have any; but that is without end, ſayes a great Father, and claſps in all times and things that ever were, or ſhall be; but this you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe none but he can. Creatures dye, and the love of Creatures; <hi>but the Love of God abides for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. And the Blood of Chriſt ſticks by us in a dying hour; yea, 'tis the only thing that ſticks by us, as great Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> ſaid; and if you, great Ladies, would waſh in that, it would make you whiter than the Snow. <hi>Waſh me,</hi> ſayes <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 52. Oh! ye had all need waſh, and pray <hi>David</hi>'s prayer, Lords, Ladies and others; but eſpecially to you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52502:47"/> great Ladies, do we commend and beg theſe few lines may be accepted: 'Tis not for your Charity alone, but good as well as Charity, that we thus plead: Gold and Silver is but little worth to us, or our School, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of God and Chriſt: Oh! look to him that ye be not undone at laſt, when ye ſhould be happy; yea, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undone; once in Hell, and never out; once in Hell, and utterly undone; other loſſes may be gained, but Heaven can never be gained, if once loſt: Ye weep for Love, and weep for Honours, weep for Frowns, and weep for Friends, many times; but how will ye weep, ſayes Chriſt, if ſuch a thing ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen! which, God forbid; namely, that ſome, or many of you, great Ladies, ſhould ever ſee great ſinners and little, we mean, mean ſinners in reſpect of you Noble Ones, that ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, from the North, and from the South, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 22. and from places where Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has never been; and yet theſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52502:47"/> ſinners ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Luke</hi> 13. 28. and you, great Ladies, ſhould be ſhut out, as Chriſt ſpeaks, into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore: Weep to think that weeping avails not. We ſuppoſe it a vain ſtory, that the Queen of <hi>Carthage</hi> wept for <hi>Aeneas,</hi> but 'tis true Divinity, that the Lord of Glory wept for the Jews, ſaying, <hi>Oh Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem! how oft would I have gathered thee, as a Hen would have gathered her Chickens? Matth.</hi> 23. 37. But oh! who can, or will weep for you, if you ſhould once miſcarry in the daies of Eternity? Nay, there will be no day, if that night once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4. But you will long, and long, and loſe your longing; for a Goſpel day can never come, when 'tis once finally loſt: Now, as we would beg from you, ſo we would beg for you, that you would mind, whilſt you may, and work whilſt you may, for the night cometh, wherein no man can
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52502:48"/> work, <hi>John</hi> 9. 3. And if indeed you would work for your Souls, God, and another world, firſt make Chriſt and his Love the ground of all your Joys and Sorrows for the future. Chriſt is a true Foundation, and others can no man lay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. Honours, Riches, Smiles, Favours, with all the Mirth, Muſick and Embraces in the world, are but Toyes to a ſoaring Soul: Yea, I have experienced it, ſaid a great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: If you would ſoar aloft, as the lofty Eagle flies, then fly away in your Soul's Loves, Joys and Pleaſures to a heavenly Object, and a heavenly Chriſt yea Chriſt in Heaven, who ſits there and ever lives to make continual Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion for ſuch ſinners as come unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34.</p>
            <p>Madam, as we would beg heartily, ſo we would deal plainly with your Honours; and your Noble Sex, do rather need more plain dealing, than any others in the world; for all things ſeem to ſmile and flatter you, and will till you be in Hell, if you have not a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52502:48"/> care; the greatneſs of your Birth, Beauty, Train, Fortune and Relations; yea, ſome of your own Chaplains deal not ſo faithfully with you as they ſhould many times, but wink at ſin, ſay little.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dives</hi> was in Hell, he would fain have ſent to his kindred then on Earth, to forewarn them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 24. but who almoſt of a thouſand gives you half that timely warning that you ſhould have, to look after Heaven, and the God of Heaven, which will be a laſting Good for ever and ever?</p>
            <p>Oh Madam! home is home, as we uſe to ſay; but there is no home like to Heaven, and he that made that; will ye mind whilſt ye may, and live whilſt ye may for Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens? I mean the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the God of all Glory, as the Apoſtle calls him. <hi>I repent of all the hours I ever ſpent in my life,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Maſon, ſave what I ſpent in communion with God:</hi> And that man will certainly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52502:49"/> wiſh he had never been in a dying hour, who lives not unto him. <hi>All things fail me now, but my God, my duty and my prayers,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Maſon.</note> So then, <hi>faith never fails,</hi> ſaid he, who had been five times Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for King <hi>James.</hi> But from all chiefly learn this, the world to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that God in Chriſt, Faith and holy Duties well performed, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failing things; that is to ſay, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duties done, by Divine aſſiſtance, and the ſenſe of his Love in Chriſt: But all things elſe fail us, and Cordials ceaſe when breath and life ſlies away. But <hi>God is my portion for ever,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, 16. 5. Money will not; nor money cannot buy one moment from the grave; for what would not ſome give, could the Phyſician help? but Faith and Holineſs will help; practiſe then the Art of well living, for the comfort of well dying. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 119. 165. Many ſhall be the ſorrows of thoſe that ſin much here or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52502:49"/> hereafter. And <hi>I ſuffer theſe pains for my ſins paſt,</hi> ſaith a great Lord. And <hi>I ſhall never ſleep more,</hi> ſaith a Carding Gentlewoman, <hi>the word Eternity doth ſo run in mine Ear.</hi> And indeed it is hard when people ſpend their time in Carding, as ſhe had done, and come to dying, to find comfort. Oh! but a good conſcience ſings ſweet; <hi>Remember, O Lord, I walk before thee,</hi> ſays good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20 3. <hi>I have finiſhed my work,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. And, <hi>I have loved, Preached, and lived to thee,</hi> ſayes <hi>Luther, Oh Chriſt, from my Soul!</hi> And <hi>ſo have I,</hi> ſays <hi>Beza; and I am weary of ſin, and willing to dye.</hi> But what have you, great Ladies, done, that you ſhould expect to live with Angels, and ſing with that Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Quire the praiſes of the Lamb to all Eternity? <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. Come and begin Heaven here on Earth, that ye be never made the tayl at laſt; you are now uppermoſt in all places, rooms and companies, would you be lowermoſt in the next world? Lords
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52502:50"/> lead you by the hand up and down ſtairs, where your ſteps go pit pat, with your ſilver Clappers: But oh! if ye do not live to Chriſt, what will become of you when the Silken Stockin, and the Silver Shoe, the Holland Shift, and all muſt off; and as ye come into the world, ſo muſt ye go; only your Mother's blood will be waſht away. Princes, Kings and Queens muſt all lye down to Death, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Lords muſt pull off their Robes; but Death can never ſtrip a Saint, nor any true believing penitent of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; no, no, Worms may eat his skin through and through, and the Grave conſume his fleſh and bones to duſt, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26. <hi>Yet ſhall I ſee my Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will he own you then, if you do not own him now? <hi>My Sheep hear my voice, and I give to them Eternal Life,</hi> ſayes Chriſt. <hi>But you would none of me, Joh.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>I have piped,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>but you would not dance; I have</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52502:50"/> 
               <hi>mourned, but ye would not lament, Mat.</hi> 11. 17. Chriſt Preached Repentance by <hi>John</hi> to the Jews, but they would not mourn: Chriſt Preached Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by himſelf, but they would not believe, nor have any of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh! take heed, and again take heed, that ye, Great and Noble, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Ladies, do not the ſame. The <hi>Gadarens</hi> once preferred their Swine before the Lord of Life and Glory, and intreated him to be gone out of their Coaſts or Country, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 37. And take ye heed that ye refuſe not the waters of <hi>Shiloah,</hi> that run ſoftly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 6. and ſlight him that ſpeaks from Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. prefer your Luſts, Toys, Honours, and every little thing before your Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Why ſhould the braying of an Aſs be more acceptable to you, than the moſt melodious Muſick of the Goſpel? I mean, baſe and mean things, before the high and heavenly ones of God: Oh! taſt and ſee that the Lord is gracious, and Religion ſweet,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52502:51"/> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>I will aſſure you 'tis,</hi> ſaid a great Counteſs to the Lord <hi>Bartlet.</hi> And, <hi>Curſed be the man,</hi> ſaid the Noble Marqueſs <hi>Galliaces, that thinks all the pleaſure in the world worth one hours communion with God.</hi> And if you would have communion with God, ſit down, and ſink down in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and converſe with your ſelves a little before ye go hence and be no more; but the Devil viſits, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty needleſs things will not let you ſit down, walk alone, or be in the dark one hour, to mind Death, Heaven, Hell and Eternity. Indeed, it is hard for a man of much buſineſs, or a Lady of much Honour and Courtſhip, to mind the main, or to live to him at all, who lives much for others. Wiſe men, and Great men, and States-men too, are great ſtrangers to themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times. Oh! let's live to our ſelves: We have lived to our Fortune, our King, and our Country; let's live to our ſelves before we go hence: All the world will not make amends, if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52502:51"/> we neglect it (ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> to Lord <hi>Burlington)</hi> who were great States-men in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time; and if you neglect it too, to breed up two or three young Lords, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſtand in your room and ſtead, meerly to maintain your Honour, and the Honour of your Families, and not mind the Honour of Chriſt, and his Exemplary Life, or Laws, which ſhould be copyed out in your Lives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Converſations; <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks; nay, do ye not worſe than others many times? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 47. As if Greatneſs were neceſſitated to abandon Piety and Goodneſs: This is a bad concluſion. Great men ſhould imitate the great Planets, and the great Deity, by being good, and doing good; but you do hurt many times by bad Examples, ſinning, leading others into ſin; ſend away your Children for a little breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the hazard of their Souls; match them to the worſt of men for a little Honour many times; weep for them
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52502:52"/> when they are ſick, and laugh when they ſin. But <hi>Cato</hi> adviſes, <hi>He that will buy a Farm, ſhould look well what Neighbours he has;</hi> but the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the perſon had need more be minded of the Young Lady's Servant, becauſe 'tis for Life; <hi>For Honour is but a ſhadow without Piety, and will prove a bubble, a bubble,</hi> as one cryed out of all the world, upon the thoughts of Eternity; indeed that ſwallows all things, as mighty Whales does the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fiſhes: how quick and ſoon this comes, God knows. Man walks, ſings, laughs and talks, and Ladies do the ſame; play upon the Lute and Citern one day, and to Death's Pipe the next: And now if Death and Night puts an end to Life and Day, what ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main but to work whilſt day and time laſt? becauſe, though another day comes, and that paſt, yet the ſame Day and Life; nor may that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be, which in your hands, if once ſlipt and gone. <hi>Oh! how much loſt time have I to repent of, and how little</hi>

               <hi>time to do it in!</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign. Man's greateſt happineſs is to be good, and at leiſure to do good; Delays and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinations of being good, and doing good, are dangerous. And, <hi>To morrow, to morrow, couzens many a one,</hi> ſayes a Father. Therefore the Wiſe man ſayes, <hi>What thou findeſt in thy heart to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no device nor work in the Grave whither thou art going, Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10. But he that dyes to ſin daily, makes the beſt ſtep to this Eternal ſtep of Death, as a great Philoſopher calls it, which puts us not into another room, but another place and condition quite, away from all we now converſe withal. Relations never meet together more, in the way and manner that they now do, but the Father puts away the Son, and the Son the Father; and this Relation is never more, nor the Marriage one neither, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 30. Death is a Divorce for ever; and though theſe Relations meet in the Reſurrection-ſtate, yet is there
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52502:53"/> neither Marriage, nor giving in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as Chriſt ſpeaks to the ſeventh Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let Husbands love their Wives, whileſt they may; and Wives their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; this ſtep and journey will part them both for ever;</hi> as one ſaid to his wife a dying, who had been married fifty years or upwards. <hi>Oh me!</hi> ſaid a young Lady, <hi>This is very ſad, that I muſt leave thee, my dear, ſo ſoon; we have not been married one year; what, is there no Remedy? and muſt I needs dye? Truly yes;</hi> he that lives muſt dye whether he be ſick or no. <hi>We dye, becauſe we liv'd;</hi> ſaid one, Death is decreed, and we dye naturally; our Bed and Sleep reſembles Death and the Grave, What is ſleep but the ſhadow of it? And he that will dye well, muſt live well; and if there be any thing after this Life, Why do not young men take care to live well? <hi>I did both,</hi> ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> though a heathen: Live and Dye well go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: <hi>What God hath joyned, let no man put aſunder: for as the tree leans,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52502:53"/> 
               <hi>ſo it falls; Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 3. Men do not live ſin-ward, and dye God ward; no, no; you muſt live to God, and lean to God; live and dye to God, if ever you mean to go to him. The Tree falls as it leans, and lies as it falls: If you fall God ward you are happy; But if ſin-ward you are miſerable; and ever like to be. <hi>For after death comes judgment;</hi> that is, <hi>the ſtating of the Soul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Burrace, in an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate.</hi> Here a mans condition may be mended, but after death its never to be altered. Faith and Repentance may be wrought here, though it be at the laſt caſt. <hi>This night ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe, Luk.</hi> 23. 43. Yet late Repentance ſeldom true; though true Repentance never too late: But after death there is no amendment nor Repentance neither. <hi>Solomon</hi> hew'd and ſquared his Building for the Temple before-hand; ſo that at the rearing of it up, there was no noiſe of the Ax or Hammer heard; Whoever God intends as a ſtone in the heavenly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52502:54"/> 
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he fits before hand: May you all be fitted, all you young and lovely Ladies, And you more elderly too; May you all ſtand before the Lamb, ſee him, have his name and praiſe in your forehead, Palms in your hands, Robes upon your backs; to cry with that numberleſs number of all kindreds, tongues and people; <hi>Salvation, Glory, Honour to the Lamb, and to him that ſits on the Throne for ever, Rev.</hi> 7. 10. Yea, may you all fall down &amp; cry, not with the cry of Lamentation, but Acclamation, Joy, and triumph; which Triumph to the Godly will certainly be; after all actions of Mortality are come to an end. In the mean time all affections have two ſharp ends, the firſt and the laſt; the firſt meeting, and the laſt parting of Friends and Lovers is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo. And as Chriſt wept for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the hardneſs of the Jews, whom <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed almoſt to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed for, that they might be ſaved; ſo the Jews ſhal one day be converted and look upon him whom they have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52502:54"/> peirced, and mourn, as for their firſt born, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7. And Paul's Friends wept ſore when he told them they ſhould <hi>ſee his face no more; Act.</hi> 21. 13. But the <hi>Mary</hi>'s wept, <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the Mother of Jeſus wept, when he ſaid in his ſufferings, <hi>Woman behold thy Son, John</hi> 19. 26. And the other <hi>Loved much, becauſe much was forgiven, Mark</hi> 8. 36. You who have all your ſins forgiven, let the memorial of his ſufferings dwell in your hearts, and 'twill make you weep to ſin againſt him; Oh! the kindneſs and favours of a good God, are obligations to a good Soul. May you all remember what he has ſhewed unto you at any time. Were you never ſick in dangers, nor partakers of ſome ſpecial mercies? Oh! keep the Remembrance of his goodneſs to your Souls. But, oh how little do rich and poor, think upon this God and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Souls! which muſt ſtand before the Lamb, as I ſaid but now, or be baniſht from him for ever and ever; or how little do they think of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52502:55"/> worth, Nature, or Immortality of them? What's a fine Silk, a fine Skin, a fine Shape, a ſweet Face to ſuch a Spark or Beam of God as the Soul is, that came out from him, and was breathed into man by him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. Shall this immortal thing ever ſtarve, dye and be forgotten? which one calls <hi>the Breath of Life, or the Living Breath which gives us Life.</hi> Some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look their Bibles, others never mind their Souls; the whole world will not make amends for ſuch a loſs, much leſs a vain wretched life of ſinful pleaſures, and a few honours. What! Careful for ſhape, and faſhion, and neglect that which is the Breath of life, or the life which gives us Breath? as I ſaid before. Good Books are good Companions, and the Bible makes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtians, when they ſo read, mind it, as to live up to it. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lov'd it well, and hug'd it in the Priſon. But vain Books eat up time, and ſpoil many young Ladies and Gentlewomen, but 'tis not lack of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52502:55"/> time, but love and reliſh to it, that you do not read, hear and pray more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what kind of fooliſh Creatures are many of you young Ladies, to think God, Chriſt, Heaven, Souls may be put off for any ſlight occaſions, or a Looking-glaſs. You were not made for Birds or Butterflies, to ſing in woods, Play, Court, or Dance in Sun: But you are made for Saints, to ſing with Angels, and go to God; or elſe to weep in Hell. Nay 'tis ſo, we will aſſure you and no otherwiſe, there is but two places; Look to the heavens, and think well what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that made them and you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 3. and you to live in them for ever. If you be his ſervants you ſhall ſing and others ſhall weep, grieve, and mourn; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 14. You ſhall drink, and others ſhall be thirſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Heavens declare his wondrous work,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and the Earth is full of his Goodneſs, Pſal.</hi> 8. 1. And will you be full of Sin, Enmity and Folly? Oh! God forbid, that ſuch
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52502:56"/> lovely Creatures as many of you young Lords and Ladies be, ſhould be full of ſin: Sin is an evil, an evil Diſeaſe in the Soul, and to the Soul, it kills it worſe than Leproſie to Eternity, if Chriſt do not ſave it: Oh! value him; fly to him; claſp about him, that ye never miſcarry in Time nor Eternity. Compare both, how ſhort is one, and long the other. <hi>The pleaſures of ſin are but for a ſeaſon, Heb.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Moſes</hi> left <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, preferring affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions before theſe pleaſures, which betrays into Gulphs, Snares and Rocks. Do not you make your ſelves unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in another world, when you may do well in both: A thouſand years ſhould be more valuable than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore: However, let not fourſcore be more to you than three or fourſcore thouſand, thouſand, thouſand. This is certain, Riches, Honours, Eſtates and Courtſhips, with all that is Terrene and Sublunary, ſhall fly away. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, before one Jot or Tittle of God's Word, Joh.</hi> 2 17.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52502:56"/> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 33. 'Tis a very dangerous thing, though you do not mind it, to be irreligious: Pleaſure one day in God's Court is worth a thouſand elſewhere, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. 10. Oh! taſte and ſee the ſweet and honey of it: Leſs pains will ſerve for Eternal Life than ſome take for Temporal; yea, to dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: What! three hours about that, and not a quarter at prayers? Some get great Fortune by Marriages, others a little by Plough, Cart and pains; others by Play, and that's almoſt cheating; but get the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you get all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. This world you ſee, but do not you believe the other, and the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction-ſtate? if you do not, you are Sadduces, and irrational. Do not you ſee all things ſpring again every year? Dead Seeds and Corn bring the ſame Grain; and ſhall not man ſpring again, as well as Worms, Flies and Spiders, which ſeem to be dead all the Winter, yet live again in the Summer? Oh! believe the Reſurrection-ſtate, and the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52502:57"/> Promiſes; for Godlineſs hath one for both worlds. But this lies in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. Shall honours, pleaſures, profits be your portion ever? it cannot be; Oh look ye after another world then! Why chooſe you not then that that you would have when you come to dye; let me dye the death of the Righteous, and my latter end be like unto his; <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 10. And every one will ſay and wiſh ſo; Let go ſin and ſorrow, take faith and you ſhall do it; how much better is that than fancy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, than earth and not heaven? God can give a thouſand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; a river of pleaſures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 8. But vain ſinful pleaſures are certainly the way to hell; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4 And I could never reconcile them and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion together: ſaid a great one. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of pleaſures that are ſinful, are really Lovers of Death, yea, the whores houſe goes down to death; her feet take hold on hell, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 16. 5. 5. He that cannot ceaſe from ſin,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52502:57"/> and repent of it muſt needs be damned for it, it is an ill bed-fellow, and a worſe grave fellow; And a cutting ſaying it was to the Jews that they ſhould dye in it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, you ſhall die in your ſins,</hi> ſayes Chriſt. Sinful luſts make men beaſts, and ſinful wrath makes men Devils: What! kill a man in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Go into the field to ſeek honour, but find Death and Hell? live a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, or dye by one? If furious ſparks did mind the ſparkles of an eternal fire; and how much the Devil is glad when he finds ſuch fools; they would never do as they do, ſight and damn one another for a thing of nought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times. <hi>My Life is of more worth,</hi> ſaid the Philoſopher to the rude Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who were ſwearing, and careleſs in a ſtorm, <hi>than to be caſt away.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Life is a thing to be valued at a high rate. And upon a Life well ſpent depends Eternal happineſs; therefore 'tis the wiſe, and not fools, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time for Eternity. The Aegyptians
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52502:58"/> pictured time with three heads; a Dog, a Lion, and a Wolf; a Dog, ſignifying Time to come, flattering; and a Lion, to denote Time preſent, ſtrongly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and a Wolf, denoting Time loſt or paſt, to be biting: And Death on a dark Throne, with a Rod in one hand, and a Key in the other; as if by one he drove us together, and the other he lockt us up. Oh Ladies! every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time commands Regions of Bleſſedneſs, when 'tis improved; but loſt, it becomes a Worm in conſcience, and eats to Eternity. If men in health, and Duellers did but mind this, they would not ſend one another to Hell as they do. Certainly ſuch Duellers will be ſad repenters (as I ſaid before) in another world: Do they believe a God? or do they not? If there be a God, he is a Rewarder of Virtue, and will certainly puniſh all unpardoned ſins which lead us into Gulphs, Snares and Rocks. Say, when temptations are upon you to any great ſin, <hi>Now are the Philiſtines come, and the Cords of</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52502:58"/> 
               <hi>Death and Hell are upon me; ſhall I be fooliſh, baſe, vile and unclean? do this and wrong my own ſoul? Prov.</hi> 8. 36. And, <hi>all that hate me love death,</hi> ſayes <hi>Solomon.</hi> Some vices have ſhort plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, long throws, and after-pains; if vice, ſin, ſinful ſin and folly, have ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed youth: Have a care of old Age; one foot is in the grave: What! ſin all your life, and have Heaven at laſt? no, it will be Hell. And, <hi>I had rather be in it,</hi> ſayes a Father, <hi>without ſin, than in Heaven filled with it.</hi> Oh! take a fair farewel of it betimes; it never did, will, nor can do any one good; no, it cannot; it brings all the loſſes, croſſes in the world on us, here, or hereafter: And how can we think of going to Heaven, if we do not live to it, but leave a Hell of ſin, ſeeds and ſpawn, by bad example behind us? or if we ſhould live for Heaven a little, and loſe it for want of living a little more, would it not be ſad?</p>
            <p>A good bargain loſt for want of a ſecond or third bidding, proves a great
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52502:59"/> vexation many times; one ſtep more and all had been well and ſafe; but to loſe a Heaven for nothing, for nothing, for want of a little Religion, and being ſerious in it, bites to Eternity. Oh! if you fall but a ſtep or two ſhort, this will be your caſe, and you will never come in. Take heed, and again take heed, O ye great Ones of the times! Lords, Ladies, and others, that ye do not miſcarry in the daies of Eternity, but give at length ſome diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure. Honours and Evidences are never ſure enough; can Heaven be too ſure for you? Come, look after God and Chriſt more; pray oftener; throw your ſelves into the Arms of Jeſus; depend upon Free Grace, and he will certainly ſave you, and your Souls: Like and love holineſs: Be in love and league with no ſin, and you ſhall have Joy, Happineſs and Holineſs to Eternity: And therefore, as ever you would be Lodgers out of Hell, live in the Church as a holy member of the Church; love
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52502:59"/> the beſt of Proteſtants, perſecution is a deviliſh ſin; And good preaching a great mercy; And if ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then are ye my diſciples indeed, ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21. And 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, that they had rather want the ſhining of the Sun than his preaching;</hi> and ſayes he, <hi>if I had a Mountain for my Pulpit, and the whole world to hear me it ſhould be upon that Text.</hi> O ye ſons of men how long will ye love vanity! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 2. The delight of the ſoul is to know its mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and heavenly preaching is a ſoul-raviſhing thing; there being infinite ſweetneſs in the love of God: But he that does not lift his head and his heart above this world; will periſh with the world. And he &amp; ſhe that is for much eaſe, new faſhions, and fine cloaths, &amp; haiting up &amp; down in Coaches is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for little religion. If you cannot live without exceſs of pleaſures, I ſay exceſſive ones, you will be carried down the ſtream of <hi>Nilus</hi> to the deadly Sea, called, <hi>Mare Mortuum;</hi> like the skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52502:60"/> fiſhes till they fall into it. Come, let brave Sparks and gallant Ladies mind better things, the great God and his Son that came down from heaven, and never knew pleaſure here on earth but in doing his Fathers Will; and if you will, now do it; when the Dore is once ſhut it is too late: Some would be troubled if they ſhould never go to the Park again, or ſee another <hi>May-</hi>day. But if you ſhould never go to heaven you are utterly undone; for there are but two places, all go to one place ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> but he means that of the grave, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. But all beſides believe two places, if the principles of Religion were never ſo dubious, yet, it concerns us to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, becauſe they are of ſuch mighty concernment to us Said the great Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Fools play with their ſouls, and drawlers at Religion cut the thread of life, and throat of them.</hi> But ſink not into this deadneſs and deadly wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to make ſin a ſport of at any time; eſpecially ſuch kind of ſinning as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52502:60"/> throws a contempt upon God and his word, and hardens others to deſpiſe and condemn that, namely Religion, which all ages and nations beſide this have never done before: But it were better to be drowned with a milſtone about our necks, than left to dye and be buried with a hard heart in the grave, or live to draw others to hell. Take heed which way you go, the broad way is moſt eaſie, but the narrow is moſt ſafe, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. Safe bind, and ſafe find; but ſin looſened, and the Reins let go, carries us whither we ſhould not, and whither we would not. If we did but conſider; but the want of due conſideration; if you will indeed do it too, then you ſhall know it more than you do, and taſte it to be far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all the ſports and pleaſures of the Court and Country too. <hi>Oh! that I had never been King of</hi> Spain, ſaid that great Prince <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>and that I had lived a Hermite's life.</hi> But a heavenly life will never be repented of: Should not Ladies ſtrive to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52502:61"/> and holy in the eyes of God, as well as lovely in the eyes of men? why ſhould you be all for Honour, and not for Religion, as ſome of you are? It becomes great Sparks to ſeek great things, and not to ſpend their time in Ladies Chambers, toſſing of a Play-Book, or reading this or that little Jeſt, crying, <hi>Faith Madam here's a good one.</hi> Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nothing concerns us ſo much in all the world as Religion, and the Principles of it.</hi>

To labour not to dye once, is to labour in vain; But to live to Chriſt, is a certain way to prevent a ſecond Death. And a man whoſe Soul is truly converſing with God, ſhall find more pleaſure in ſecret walks, cloſets, groves and hedges, than in the Palace of a Prince. And Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſayes, <hi>He that is reſolved to be a great Favourite and Servant there, muſt abandon ſtrict Piety.</hi> The love of Fame, Name and Pleaſure, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Love of God. True, a weak man may give ſtrict Rules; and the holieſt Miniſter in the world hardly lives up to his own Preaching. And you cannot look to Heaven with one Eye, and look down to the Earth with the other at the ſame time. But however, the beſt counſel is beſt and moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for our Souls: And though our care be great for the Body, yet a man may be as happy in Ruſſet as in Cloth

            <p>And <hi>I ſee,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Emperor, that ſovereignty commands no diſeaſes nor the ſeas, having ſet himſelf and chair on the ſhore at the Tides coming in, crying back, back, and I command you, proud waves, back:</hi> but the Emperor was fain to move.

Sick repentance is ſeldom true, and 'tis certain 'tis labour and trouble enough to be head and heart ſick; and then a man can hardly do any thing but mind his eaſe, or pillow. Oh! put not off your Will but eſpecially your ſouls weal and happineſs to a dying hour; <hi>My care was, when young, to live well, and 'tis now to dye well,</hi> ſaid a <hi>Heathen.</hi> Phyſicians, Lawyers, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters cannot be heard at once; and it may be friends are troubleſom too: Come, to live well is beſt, and that will prevent the worſt: Oh! then play not the Courtiers part who, ſome ſay, do all things late, Riſe late, Dine late, Sup late, and Repent late, many times never, but it is never too late if true, but

Time paſſes a pace, and all poſt ſome where. 'Tis dangerous putting off that to day, which thou muſt do, or elſe it may be utterly undone to morrow. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and Meditation, are good things: 'Tis as the ſmell of the

And 'tis better to ſpend our time in doing good, than bare talking or getting Riches either. If we ſhould be thankful for little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Riches and Honour; what ſhould we be for God himſelf, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin? The Tongue bleſſing God without the heart, is but a tinkling Cymbal; and the heart bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God without the tongue, is ſweet, but ſtill muſick; but the heart and tongue together makes the ſweeteſt harmony in the world. And if the Larks and Birds ſing ſo merrily to the morning Sun, we ſhould much more to our Creator and Redeemer. <hi>Let all the world praiſe thee, O God; Let all the world praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal</hi> 67. 3. And you, Noble Ladies, who have beſt voices, and leaſt to do, ſhould be moſt engaged in that good work.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52502:75"/> But Honour is a ſnare, and viſits many, and needleſs too ſometimes: Better ſtay at home, and think, <hi>Lord, what am I? What do I?

A good Gentlewoman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick, was askt whether ſhe were willing to Live or Dye; <hi>What God pleaſed.

            <p>Soul mercies, Soul-promiſes, and Soul-ſalvation, muſt needs be great. And the Great God by his abſolute Sovereignty claims, and ſayes, <hi>All Souls are mine; Ezek.</hi> 18. 4. But

            <p>Many ſcramble for a little Dirt, Duſt, Gold and Honour, but when Death comes, they will cry out, <hi>Oh my Soul!

               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:52502:77"/> but yet, yet for all this, Chriſt is more worth being God-man, than all the fouls in the world put together, how much better are ſoul-comforts than bodily ones, and ſo for mercies. <hi>Oh! let me have the Cream,</hi> ſayes one, <hi>and let others take the ſcum'd milk, ſorrow for ſin and contrition is good, but it muſt not keep us from believing and hopeing in him:</hi> carnal joys breed ſorrow, but ſpiritual ſorrow breeds joy, and is a repentance never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. In wicked laughter the heart is ſad or ſhould be, for ſayes Chriſt, <hi>woe be to you that laugh, Luk.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>but in holy mourning the heart is ſecretly glad: therefore bleſſed are all ye that mourn for ye ſhall be comforted.

            <p>'Tis one thing to ſin, and another to be overcome or taken by ſin; but 'tis ſad if that which comes from God ſhould daily cauſe us to ſin againſt and forget him; yet high fortunes lead ſome men to ſad lives and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions; yea, they think it ſtrange to ſay their prayers, or do as others do, when they are newly come out of France, and exceeding modiſh; <hi>Oh! my Son, my Son</hi> ſaid old <hi>Fox,</hi>

            <p>'Tis a hard thing to loſe him and all for nothing; or to look up to Heaven with one Eye, and down to the World and Vanity with another. And 'tis hard to commit one ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Sin hangs to ſin, as ſpawn to ſpawn, and links to links in a Chain.

'Tis eaſie and hard to tell but a Lye; ſomething or other will tend or go along with it.</p>

Well, good men and good Miniſters have the Law, Love and Grace of God in their hearts, and do for love of Souls more than money: Neither do they love chopping and changing: But a great Benefice is a great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52502:80"/> even to a good man; but to many is certainly a great ſin in Giver and Receiver. <hi>But I will live and dye with my Flock, as I ſhould, Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4. ſaid a good man. And 'tis more honour to be a heavenly, holy, zealous Preacher, than a rich Drone, a thouſand times. Some Shepherds have for little ſo much, that the great Shepherd will owe them nothing at all: Others have ſo little for their faithfulneſs, that he will give them a Crown. 'Tis better for Miniſters it ſhould be ſaid, Why are not you and you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for? than, Why have ſuch and ſuch ſo much? As he nobly ſaid, <hi>I had rather it ſhould be ſaid, Why does not</hi> Cato<hi>'s Image ſtand here? than it ſhould be ſaid, Why does it ſtand here?</hi> But Preachers of Faith, muſt live by Faith, as well as other men; and the world to come will make amends for all. <hi>Come, Thee and I ſhall be happy when King Jeſus comes,</hi> ſaid one to his friend. <hi>And they that fear the Lord ſpeak often one to another, Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>And</hi>

But many men make work for Repentance; and many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters never put them ſeriouſly upon it as they ſhould, for want of Skill, Love, Faithfulneſs or Zeal. The Lion ſent for the Wolf, and asked him if he had not a ſtinking breath: <hi>Yea, Sir,</hi> ſaid he; and for that he tore him in pieces; and ſent for the Dog, and asked him; no, ſaid he; 'tis very ſweet; for that he tore him in pieces; and ſent for the Fox, and asked him, who cunningly told him, <hi>He had a great Cold in his head, and could not ſmell;</hi> and ſo ſaved his Skin. 'Tis a brave thing when neither fear nor flattery moves men nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from ſaying what they ſhould, few love Reproof, fewer who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for love of ſouls, and feweſt of all who ſincerely love the reprover: <hi>Am I your enemy becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4. 16. and we may ſay the greateſt ſin timely repented of is pardonable, but

'Tis for us to bring our will over to God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and not his to us in any thing contrary to his Law and holy Writ whilſt the world ſtands; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is an inward thing, takes off from ſelf and creature; but gives to God reverence in the heart; and the heart and ſum of religion is to love God and our Neighbours ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; but Religion can do more for Learning than Learning can for Religion, can bleſs and ſanctifie that, but that can do nothing but adorn, dreſs, and ſet it out with words, which yet is a moſt excellent thing; And oh! that all the preachers in the world were practiſers and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too; but more eſpecially the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; yet ſayes God, <hi>I will ſet thy Sons, O Sion! againſt thy Sons, O Greece!

Yet the world is apt to think of Religion clean contrary to what it is, ſayes Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> and to make it madneſs; a thing that dulls ſpirits, and is apt to make Ladies look wrinkled before their time; depreſſes them of Joy; and to be looked upon by Wits and Sparks as ſome of God Almighty's Shee-fools,

And <hi>I am in my Paradice and Palace with God and his Angels,</hi> ſaid the Noble Marqueſs <hi>Galliaces,</hi> in the Dungeon. And <hi>I have Chriſt, who is, was, and ever will be all in all,</hi> ſayes another; All in Health, Life, Death, and Sickneſs, and Eternity too, to Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52502:83"/> Yea, ask your own Conſcience when the Curtain's drawn, and the Candle out; Which is beſt, a houſe of Prayer, a houſe of God, or a Play-houſe? or a days ſinning, or a days commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and waiting on God and his Worſhip? Come, fy, piſh, you are mad, if you prefer the pleaſures of ſin before Heaven, or ſinful paſtime before Heaven's Joy. Oh ye vain and fooliſh young Ladies! do not think of being Religious when you have nothing elſe to do; but lay aſide the Lute and Citern now, and dance a little in your thoughts to Death's Pipe; and think you hear his Night-watch, and where you ſhall be a hundred years hence; and what when you have lain a month or two in the Grave; and this will help you to be good betimes. Young Ladies might be merry enough, if they would be good and godly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin betimes, and have better Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands too; for good men will love good Ladies; eſpecially when they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52502:83"/> are young and good too: And we hope ſome are left, though but a few, that look for Heaven and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Wives. True Recreations are in another world: All the pleaſures of this are either ſins or ſnares, if we uſe them too much: But moderation may be; and there is a time for every thing under the Sun, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 1. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſin; and for that you ſhall hardly ſin in moderate mirth and pleaſure: But to make Recreation a toil, and the Buſineſs of your Life, is folly and madneſs: What! nothing but hait, hait up and down, as ſome do, and never to a Lecture; or ſcarce on the Lord's Day in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon? <hi>I ſaid of Laughter, Thou wert mad,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 2. It may be they ſing too, which had need to weep and pray. But let not your high Fortunes make you too high-minded: For they that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better for Gold, Pearl and Lace; and are proud, and diſdain others, which yet is very natural; and we are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52502:84"/> all apt to fall this way; which makes us worſe than Gold Slaves, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to it; ſayes <hi>Anſelmus.</hi> But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what you ſhall be in the Grave, eſpecially in Hell, if you ſhould go there: And wanton thoughts and plumes will all fall; but humble great ones, are good ones indeed; and God will exalt ſuch, and make them higher than they are; and men will love them more. Humble Great ones are double Great ones, and twice as honourable as others of the ſame rank: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not great Fortunes make you proud and unfortunate; yet a grain muſt be allowed for Old <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſake, whoſe Children we all are.</p>
            <p>And 'tis eaſier in a miniſter to preach down <hi>Adam</hi> in others, than to beat it down in himſelf, wife, or children; but ſound men ſhould love ſound preaching; the beſt wine is beſt, and ſo is the beſt preaching, and that that comes from the heart goes to it; ſo ſay and ſo do is good in a good miniſter, ſome ſpeak more
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52502:84"/> briefly than they live, as <hi>Cato</hi> told his friends; but do not ſay I will and don't: we read of two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; one ſaid he would do his Fathers will but did it not; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid he would not but did it; and that was better than the other. When prayers and praiſe go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the heart with both, God is well pleaſed, and the muſick ſweet; when the tongue doth not go from the inward motions; the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee ſaid, <hi>I thank God, and I do this, and I do this;</hi> but the poor Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſaid, <hi>The Lord be merciful to me a ſinner, Luk.</hi> 18. 13. and he was juſtified, hand and tongue went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſome forget to pray, becauſe they have too much of the world, and ſome neglect becauſe they want it, and muſt work early and late, but 'tis a miſery and a ſin not to be excuſed in any; pray if you be rich, and pray if you be poor, or elſe thou ſayeſt in effect, God, I have nothing to do with thee: don't ſay
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52502:85"/> you forgot it; for that is a ſoul-careleſs trick, few forget their din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but it is better to faſt all day than not to pray in a day, and a little meditation does well; what ask of God and not think what to ask, or why? they who have moſt grace have ſomething to ask, and they that have leaſt have ſomething to ask, but they that have none, have all to ask; for they want Chriſt, pardon and every thing; yet God will give them his holy Spirit if they do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ask it: <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. Ask then, and down upon your ſilken knees, O ye great Lords, Ladies and others, that you might have his holy ſpirit and his heavenly will revealed in and to you ſo as to do it, live it, and love it; it will be your glory, heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever if you do ſo indeed; but if you ſlight him now, you will need him, miſs him, and want him hereafter, and never find him. 'Tis a mercy to have many good things in this world; but what a miſery is it if you ſhould have
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52502:85"/> all, and be ſaid, <hi>Son, Remember thou in thy life time hadſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things, Luk.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>therefore he is comforted, and thou art tormented:</hi> A Scripture that made <hi>Gregory</hi> the great weep, or tremble, as himſelf ſaid, for fear to think leſt he had received his good things. Come, Heaven's a ſweet Cake; but who would eat it before-hand, or take Earth for it? Sweet-meats are the laſt diſh, but it will be ſowr ſauce if you loſe all in concluſion. Read to the end of the Chapter. Come, come, a godly Life is beſt, and beſt for you, great Counteſſes, and you Ladies more elderly, and young ones too; though you be not twelve or thirteen: Let head and heart remember that, and what Angelical things you would be, if you would begin betimes, as the beſt did. <hi>Joſiah, Samuel, Timothy, John,</hi> were all young Saints, and the moſt eminent in the Book of God; the laſt leaned in Chriſt's boſom; dipt his Pen and his Quill in the Love of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52502:86"/> God, and ſtrows all his Epiſtles with it.</p>
            <p>But how frail a thing is man (and you are the ſame, or more: The <hi>Venice-glaſs</hi> is ſooneſt broke;) that ſings, walks, talks, and yet is gone as a Tale, Dream, or Watch in the night! And he is no man that does not need mending more than a Watch, and oftner winding up to mind Heaven and heavenly things: For this world is bad, and too bad too; mend one, and make it better; mend one, and draw twenty; great perſons do alwaies ſo; for many follow them and their Examples, which way ſoever they go. When Magiſtrates hearts are towards God, the People's are ſo too: And when Magiſtrates hearts are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the People, the Peoples hearts are towards them. Love begets Love; and they that do not love, will not be beloved. Love comes down; good Parents, Magiſtrates, Maſters and Landlords too, if they be kind, and love them beneath: But the Love of God is the beſt Love of all; therefore Magiſtrates, Miniſters and People,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52502:86"/> ſhould all love him; and you Ladies, which are uppermoſt in this world, will be lowermoſt in Hell if ye forget him. True Love ſeeks how to pleaſe him: If you love your Lords much, that is well, and it is but your duty; but if ye love Chriſt leſs, that is ill; but if God not at all, he will never care for you, nor what becomes of you, when Honours have done with you, and you with them. 'Tis better to love God now, though you do not ſee him, than not to love him and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him. Love God, and he will love you with that Love which has no end, nor never ſhall have. Your Lord and your Husband will love you no longer after a little time; but Chriſt will love you with an everlaſting Love, and draw you to himſelf; if all things in the world are not good enough for you and your Souls. If you love God, he will give you himſelf, the World to come, and his Son for ever; and your Soul ſhall live, becauſe he lives; and that is moſt where it loves; and ſhall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52502:87"/> be quite with him after a little while, if it love him moſt. But oh! Love, Love, whither goeſt thou to love, when thou goeſt from God, Chriſt, and Self-happineſs. Self-love and happineſs is to love God, and God above all: <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? or whom do I deſire in compariſon of thee?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. There was a time when you deſired your Lord much; but did you ever deſire your Lord Chriſt a little? if you did, do it more and more; his Name, his Nature, his Perſon, and his Promiſe is altogether deſirable, and ſhall be remembred in all Generations, and praiſed for ever and ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 17. Therefore his Love is better than Wine, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. Yea, the wine of Angels; for this is that that they drink in the perpetual beholding of him; and you ſhall ſee my face too, ſayes God, if you be his Servants, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4. But do not think of Reigning with God in Heaven, if you be not his Servants here; and your preſent Heaven is nothing to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52502:87"/> that. Lift up your Eyes and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and he that made them; all your Heavens are but Dreams and Smoak. <hi>What art thou that forgetſt the Lord thy Maker, Iſa.</hi> 51. 13. <hi>that hath ſtretched forth the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the Earth? and art afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and be as graſs? Look unto Abraham,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom be deſirable, his Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ſo too.</p>
            <p>Some have the art to make much of little, but few to make God all as <hi>Abraham</hi> did when he told him <hi>I am thy ſheild and exceeding great reward, Gen.</hi> 15. 1. and it is not in the power of any but he who is all and filleth all in all, to give to all abundantly what their Souls do want; <hi>Herod would give half his Kingdom for nothing, but</hi> St. <hi>John Baptiſt's head pleaſed the young Gib well enough; Matt.</hi> 14. 8. He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repentance, and Chriſt forgiveneſs; a Prophet may inſtruct us, but Chriſt only makes us to profit by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52502:88"/> of the word; Oh! pray, pray that hearing you may hear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 14. and know him whom to know is life eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. though knowledge may be without Grace, yet true Grace is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge; <hi>and I know my redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lives</hi> ſaies <hi>Job,</hi> 19. 25. and that you have not the love of God in you, ſaies Chriſt to the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 42. and his ſatisfaction for us is more the ground of our juſtification before God, than his ſanctification in us; and yet Chriſt in us too, is the hope of glory: Oh! let him live in your hearts by faith, 'twill breed joy, and feed joy, a true Chriſtian taſts that here, which will be unſpeakable hereafter; here his joys enter into us, hereafter we ſhall enter into it; and the ſweetneſs of divine love paſſeth all knowledge, men taſte a little here, but raviſhment is for frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: be induſtrious till you come there, for the induſtrious man is not at leiſure to ſin; heavenly meditations keep the mind buſie when the hand is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52502:88"/> at plough or play: but <hi>play dayes,</hi> ſaid Biſhop <hi>Latimer, are the Devils work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes;</hi> and he has more ſin in one of them than in a whole week beſides: Religion allows not much idleneſs, for he that will not work muſt not eat by <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule. Admire God in your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and out of thy calling, and the fields will give you room and objects enough for meditations and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations if you be not vain and airy, but you muſt take care, and watch thoughts, or elſe you'l looſe God in your mind, which is the honey in the way: Oh! what is the bough, the buſh, and the green, but a little thing he ſends every ſpring; a little Daiſy has a fine head, but all the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it, nor one hair white or black. Oh! admire God in his works which are paſt finding out, ſaies <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. 1. if they were happy which ſtood before <hi>Solomon</hi> as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 31. what are they that ſhall ſtand before the Lamb, to admire him to Eternity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 15. Come, begin heaven on
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52502:89"/> earth, admire him here and you ſhall hereafter in a ſinleſs ſtate; here we ſin and ſerve him too, not in ſin, that is the Devil's work, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. there we ſhall be without ſin, and never fear, nor offend; but love him to all eternity, and be beloved of him, Saints, and Angels too; Oh! may you dwell among them for ever, and that is beſt of all; but the beſt of and whole of this world is not worth one half quarter of the world to come; That, that makes heaven full of Joy is; that it is above all fears; and that that makes hell ſo full of terrour is, that it is below all hopes; the certainty, perpetuity, and eternity of it never ends, nor the worm dyes ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 44. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 24. ſin breeds death, and the worm feeds upon the Conſcience in remembrance of it, ſo that a man or womans own hell comes much from and lies moſt in themſelves, by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe providence of a juſt and wiſe God ordering of it ſo; ſee and buy
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52502:89"/> Mr. <hi>Strongs</hi> little book upon the Worm of conſcience; we grieve, and take care that little ones be not ſick and dye of the worms, but ſeldom take good and ſound repentance our ſelves through the blood of Chriſt to kill the worm to come. Oh! that ſin may dye, and Chriſt live in all your hearts, grace increaſe, and that decreaſe; grace is glory begun; a bud, beam, and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, and a grain of it is more worth than all the hypocritical knowledge in the world; and through juſtifying grace, ſcarlet ſins and ſinners are made whiter than ſnow by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 2. and the true preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Goſpel is the breaking of one heart, and the binding up of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the hard is to be broken, and the bruiſed is to be bound up; much of the Miniſter or good Phyſicians skill lies in this: Oh, how good is it to have ſuch a good Phyſician; or to look out if we have not! and if it be good for us to draw near unto God by prayer; is it not ſo for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52502:90"/> him to draw near unto us by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace, Pardon and Forgiveneſs to us in the Miniſtry. Yea, 'tis this way that he ſpeaks Peace to his People. And every faithful Miniſter hath as much the Power and Key this way as another. For 'tis but in Preaching and Believing: They tell us of the Love of God, and we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and believe through the Blood of Chriſt; and this applying and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, becomes our Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs. Oh! believe God is a giving, and a ſin-forgiving God, and has two places, one above, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther below in a broken heart; and if he dwell with a penitent, what may not that heart get by him? And for old and paſt ſins, it is our Heaven to be rid of them; for they would have run us to Hell, if we had continued in them. When God is in the heart, and ſin out, we might well ſay, <hi>The worſt is gone, and the beſt is come:</hi> praiſe be to him that maketh the change, and is unchangeable in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52502:90"/> 
               <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6. and in all his Attributes. And he is a Fool that ſaith, <hi>There is no God;</hi> or, <hi>That the Love of God hath not wonderfully appeared to Mankind by Jeſus Chriſt, Titus</hi> 3. 4. Oh! be rich in Faith, and you ſhall never be poor in the world to come: And they that are moſt full of that, have moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and experience too, of his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Faith is the Life of the Soul, and Chriſt is the Life of our Faith. Oh! live upon him, and you ſhall live with him, and never dye, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. Do not be offended with him, nor they that are his. Great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waves have beat upon the Rock, but the Church remains ſtill, and the Gates of Hell, Sin, Death and Deſpair, nor Enemies neither, ſhall ever prevail againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. Some ſet their hearts upon God, others againſt the Church; but thoſe that malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perſecute good men, will find ill Rewards. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me? Act.</hi> 9. 4. 'Tis a mad thing to be furiouſly mad againſt good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52502:91"/> people. If ever we expect to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we muſt be holy, and hate no man for it; for without it no man ſhall ſee God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p>But the Devil tempts men to ſin, and then to deſpair, and good men are full of doubts after ſinning: Oh! begin to live to God before you dye; and a man may live, ſin, dye, and be utterly loſt in a little time; ſome thieves rob a long time, others are quickly taken and executed, but Gods patience is great towards moſt men; yet ſome have but little ſport for their ſouls; airy Sparks ride poſt and quickly ſin away their time, but fair and ſoft is too faſt to hell and the Devils; and death would not be half ſo troubleſom were it not for ſin; but he that leads a good life, takes a great deal of comfort with him to his end, and that death of his frees his ſoul for ever; nothing can trouble in heaven, unleſs it be want of living, or more living unto God on earth; and nothing can be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52502:91"/> more terrible in hell than to think there was a time they might, but 'tis paſt, 'tis paſt; <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to dye, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 29. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> deſired to live, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20. 3. and it was well enough for them and his ſervants any way, <hi>For whether we live or whether we dye we are the Lords, Rom.</hi> 14. 8. for if indeed we be ſo we can never dye amiſs. A wiſe man never looſes his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom though he be a ſleep, nor a good man his grace, though he be catcht away before he is aware; yet it is beſt to do as <hi>Job</hi> ſayes, <hi>Wait for our Change, Job</hi> 14. 14. Death is never the nearer, nor farther off for mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not minding; and young men have it at their backs, as well as old men in their faces; yet the familiar riſing of it in our thoughts, will make it leſs ſtrange, and more welcom when it comes; if it be from trouble to comfort, and not from light to darkneſs, and the dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where light ſhall never be. <hi>Oh</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:52502:92"/> 
               <hi>that ſinners would prevent weeping, by weeping; and their own miſery, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming God's Servants!</hi> as a good Lady ſaid.

Oh! hazard your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit if it be counted diſcredit to fear him, for 'tis not unlovely or not commendable to love, what is moſt lovely, Chriſt and his wayes; <hi>Great peace have they that keep his laws,</hi>

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. but ill company will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit evil for company; and two or three men were lately ſtabbed by their companions who haunted ill houſes; but good company never hurts, and the houſe of mourning is better than the houſe of feaſting many times; And Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> was troubled for but drinking at Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s court, becauſe ſhe would not hearken to the Goſpel nor his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in King <hi>Edward</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s dayes; and good men ſhould every where ſavour of the fear of God, be much in ſelf-try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and in ſelf-denial too, and to take up his croſs when Chriſt layes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as that good man did at the ſtake for his counſel or ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word of God, but the worſt of Chriſt or ſuffering for him is better than the beſt of all the world. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung in the Stocks, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25. ſo did <hi>Hampſhire Philpot</hi> in <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Cole-houſe.

            <p>But for <hi>John Huſs,</hi> he was burnt in the Year 1415. There being a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52502:104"/> Council about three Popes, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals being divided after <hi>Alexander</hi> the fifths Death; to which Council the Emperor commanded <hi>John Huſs</hi> to go, giving him his ſafe conduct to paſs and return; in which journey he preacht, and ſet up letters of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every City.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Conſtantine</hi> he was ſent for by the Cardinals, impriſoned, and tyed up to a Rack, againſt a Wall; many Nobles and Lords of <hi>Bohemia</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for him, but that would do no good.</p>
            <p>But a good thing it is for great Lords to appear on the behalf of poor Miniſters, when impriſoned and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for the Truth; yea, there were fifty of them in <hi>Bohemia</hi> that ſtood up and petitioned for him and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague.</hi> A brave pattern for all Ages, when the Truth is ſuffering; but yet all ſignifi'd nothing: For when the Council had degraded and condemned him, he kneeled down, ſaying, <hi>Lord Jeſus forgive them, they</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:52502:105"/> 
               <hi>know not what they do.</hi> In degrading of him, they pared off the hair ſo cloſe, that they even cut the skin off his Crown, the Council having made an Order, <hi>That Faith was not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Going to be burnt, they put upon him a Triple Crown of Paper, all painted over with ugly Devils; which when he ſaw, he ſaid, <hi>My Lord Jeſus did wear a Crown of Thorns for me, and I will this for his ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>We do commit thy Soul to the Devil:</hi> (We believe it was in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, for uſually ſuch wickedneſſes are ſo pronounced) <hi>But I,</hi> ſaid John Huſs, <hi>do commit it to my dear Redeemer, Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he lifted up his head, the Crown of Paper fell off, but they put it on again, ſaying, <hi>Let him be burnt with his Maſters the Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as they tied his Neck with the Chain, he ſmiling, ſaid, <hi>This I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:52502:105"/> 
               <hi>for Preaching of the Holy Goſpel,</hi> ſinging three times with a loud voice, <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thou Son of the Living God, have mercy on me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He told them at his Death, <hi>God would raiſe up out of the Aſhes of the Gooſe</hi> (for ſo <hi>Huſs</hi>'s Name ſignified in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Language) <hi>in</hi> 100 <hi>Years, a Swan in</hi> Germany, <hi>whoſe Singing would affright all the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> which was exactly fulfilled in <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> he was ſo bold and zealous, that he wrote certain Letters, which he ſent to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> to be ſet up upon the Gates of Noblemen and Cardinals; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purity and clearneſs of his Faith and Doctrine for which he was accuſed, and that he was ready to come and make good all he had Preached.</p>
            <p>His great Crime was, he had thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered againſt the ill Lives of the Monks and Fryers; but being taken into cuſtody, he was ſadly uſed, fed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52502:106"/> with Bread and Water, and tyed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Neck and Heels together, ſo that he ſell ſick. After a long time they required him to ſubſcribe, <hi>That</hi> John Huſs <hi>was juſtly put to Death;</hi> which he did partly for fear of Death, and hoping to eſcape their hands: But he ſoon repented, ſaying before the Council, <hi>All the Sins he ever committed in his Life, did not half ſo much gnaw and trouble his Conſcience, as that peſtiferous Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had condemned him, he ſaid, <hi>I Cite you all to anſwer it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> 100 <hi>Years before the moſt High Judge of Heaven and Earth; in the mean time I leave a remorſe and nail in your Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was bound to the Image of <hi>John Huſs,</hi> and had a Paper-Crown of red Devils painted on his head.</p>
            <p>When the Executioner went to kindle the Fire behind him, he bade him do it before his Face, ſaying, <hi>If I had been afraid of Death, I had not come to this place, for I had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:52502:106"/> 
               <hi>to eſcape; but this Soul of mine, in burning flames, Oh Chriſt I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for his Oration that he made before the Council, it is ſaid, That no Tongue is able to expreſs that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elegancy and Braveneſs of his Speech, ſhewing what the Beſt of Men had ſtill ſuffered in all Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Latimer</hi> was a zealous Papiſt, till Mr. <hi>Blinny</hi> converted him, and then he was made Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter;</hi> he preached twice a day, and in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days he was laid up in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he rode through <hi>Smithfield,</hi> he ſaid <hi>that had groaned for him many Years.</hi> He uſed to pray for three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That as God had made him a Preacher of his holy Word, that he might ſeal it with his Blood, if cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God of his Mercy would reſtore his Goſpel to <hi>England</hi> once again, once again. Shall we not prize it?</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:52502:107"/>
            <p> Thirdly, That the Lord would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and make her a Comfort to the Comfortleſs Realm: At his Burning, the Blood run out of his Heart ſo abundantly, as if all the Blood in his Body had gathered there, according to his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which ſtruck the beholders with Aſtoniſhment. In the Fire, he ſtroakt his Face with his Hand, crying out, <hi>Oh! Father of Heaven, receive my Soul;</hi> and ſo died, 1555. <hi>Ridley,</hi> in the ſame Year, writing to <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Good Father, aſſiſt me with your Prayers; for unleſs God ſtand by me, I ſhall play but the part of a white liver'd Knight:</hi> At his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſtood bare, till the Cardinal named the Pope, and then he put on his Cap. A Woman weeping for him, a day before his Suffering, he cried, <hi>Ah! Miſtreſs, I ſee you love me not; it appears you will not be at my Marriage to Morrow</hi> (meaning his Burning) <hi>nor will be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,</hi> A Friend offering to watch
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52502:107"/> with him, he cried, <hi>I intend to go to Bed, and ſleep as quietly as ever I did in my Life:</hi> At the Stake, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Into thy Hands I commend my Spirit; Lord Jeſus receive my Soul.</hi> But the Fire being preſt down by much Wood, he deſired for Chriſt's ſake, to let the Fire come up to him; his lower part and Legs were quite burnt before his upper part, ſo that he fell into the Fire. He going one day by Water, the <hi>Thames,</hi> being very rough, and the Watermen being a little fearful, he cried, <hi>Fear not, you carry one that muſt be Burnt, and not Drowned. John Bradford,</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by <hi>Booker,</hi> to enter upon the Miniſtry; and he modeſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his want of Parts and Learning: <hi>Oh!</hi> ſays Booker, <hi>be not diſcouraged, if you have not fine Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, give them Barley Bread.</hi> But being in Priſon Condemned, one comes running to him, <hi>Oh! Mr.</hi> Bradford, <hi>I bring you heavy News, you muſt be burnt to Morrow, I ſaw</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:52502:108"/> 
               <hi>your Chain a buying:</hi> At which, he plucked off his Cap, ſaying, <hi>I thank God for it, the Lord make me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi> lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Life with God's diſpleaſure, is worſe than Death; and Death with his true Favour, is better than Life. Oh,</hi> England! <hi>repent of thy Sins, repent; beware of Idolatry and falſe Preachers, and take heed they don't deceive you:</hi> A good Prayer. And to another, he ſaid, <hi>Be of good comfort, my Brother, for we ſhall have a merry Supper with the Lord.</hi> He was ſo Charitable, that in a hard Time, he ſold his Jewels and Rings, to relieve them that were in Want: He was ſo humble, that he often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſome of his Letters, The moſt miſerable hard Hearted unthankful Sinner, <hi>John Bradford,</hi> a painted Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rowland Taylor</hi> was a great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and would often viſit the Poor and Sick, and relieve them too, when Bedridden; but being threatned by
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52502:108"/> the Biſhop's Purſurvant, he ſaid, <hi>I know my Cauſe to be ſo good and juſt, that</hi> I <hi>will appear before them, and to their Beards, reſist their falſe Doings;</hi> I <hi>fear not their Lordly looks, nor the Proudest of them all.</hi> Going to the Fire, he told the Sheriff. I <hi>ſhall deceive a great many, being a fat Man; for,</hi> ſaid he, I <hi>thought the Worms in</hi> Hadley <hi>Church-yard must have had me, but now</hi> I <hi>ſee</hi> I <hi>must be Burnt:</hi> Giving one or two Leaps, and ſaid, <hi>God be praiſed,</hi> I <hi>am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at Home:</hi> But the People cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Oh, dear Father, and good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, God help and ſuccour thee, as thou hast done us many times, and our poor Children;</hi> and ſo they went weeping all along the Streets for him: To whom he ſaid, I <hi>have preached to you God's Truth and Word, and now am going to ſeal it with my Blood.</hi> In the Flames, he cried, <hi>Merciful Father of Heaven, for Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour's ſake, receive my Soul:</hi> And ſo departed.</p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:52502:109"/>
            <p> A Popiſh Doctor told <hi>Tindal,</hi> (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting about Religion) <hi>That it were better to be without God's Law than the Popes.</hi> Tindal replied, <hi>I defie the Pope and all his Laws.</hi> He tranſlated the Teſtament into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> but the Popiſh party exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raged, ſaying, <hi>There were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Errors in it:</hi> And for his good Works he was Impriſoned, Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Burnt; but at his Death he cried, <hi>Lord, open the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>'s Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Hooper,</hi> who Died 1555, being writ to by one out of <hi>England,</hi> to ſend him ſome News; he ſaid, <hi>He had no News to ſend him, but that the laſt News that you will hear of me, will be, That where</hi> I <hi>have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken moſt pains to preach the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, there</hi> I <hi>ſhall be burnt to Aſhes.</hi> But one perſuading him to Fly; <hi>No,</hi> ſays he, I <hi>will live and die with my Sheep.</hi> But being ſent for to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he was Committed to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> where he was miſerably uſed, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52502:109"/> even poyſoned with the common Ditch; but being Sick, he cried and called for help, but the Warden ſaid, <hi>Let him alone, if he die, it will be a good riddance:</hi> But a Knight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, told him, <hi>Life was ſweet, and Death bitter:</hi> To which he replied, <hi>Death to come is more bitter, and Life to come more ſweet.</hi> But being profered his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don going to the Execution, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>If you love my Soul, if you love my Soul, away with it:</hi> He prayed at the Stake, <hi>Jeſus, thou Son of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>have mercy upon me, and receive my Soul:</hi> And wiping his Face with his Hand, cried, <hi>For God's ſake, let me have more Fire.</hi> And a third Fire being kindled, he was yet alive; but the laſt words he ſpoke were, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lawrence Saunders,</hi> meeting with one <hi>Pembleton,</hi> another Miniſter, ſaid, I <hi>have many fears if</hi> I <hi>ſhould come to Suffer, or Die for Religions ſake.</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:52502:110"/> 
               <hi>What need you fear,</hi> ſaid Pembleton, <hi>you have but a lean Body, but</hi> I <hi>have a fat one? yet you ſhall ſee the laſt gobbet and Greaſe of mine melt or fry away, rather than deny Chriſt, or the leaſt of his Truth, which</hi> I <hi>have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</hi> Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> being called, a while after Impriſoned, Tried, and Condemned, cried, <hi>Welcome Chriſt, welcome Chriſt, welcome Eternal Life;</hi> and the Fire being kindled, ſweetly ſlept in God, ſealing the Truth with his Blood: But faint-hearted <hi>Pembleton,</hi> for all his Self-boaſting, played Apoſtate in a ſmall time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Rogers</hi> might have eſcaped, and had many Motives, a Wife and ten Children, and had Friends in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> if he would have gone; he helped to Tranſlate the Bible into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but <hi>Bonner</hi> ſent him to <hi>Newgate</hi> amongſt Thieves, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers: And being Condemned, he deſired to have his Wife admitted to ſee him, but that would not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

His Wife then, with nine Children, and the tenth ſucking at her Breaſt, were brought to him, but this ſorrowful ſight no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moved him; but in the Flames he took his Death with wonderful Patience: The Sabbath before his Death, he drank to Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> who lay in a Chamber beneath him, bidding the Meſſenger tell him, <hi>That by God's Grace, never little Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtuck cloſer to a man than he would to him,</hi> ſuppoſing they ſhould be both Burnt together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Blinney,</hi> in the Year 1531, had been in Priſon, and was drawn to Abjure and Submit himſelf, after which he fell into terrors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for almoſt a Year; being through God's Mercy reſtored to Comfort, he
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52502:111"/> reſolved to lay down his Life for that Truth which he before had Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he Preached openly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of himſelf for his Fact, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them beware they did not truſt in Fleſh nor Friends in matters of Religion, but was ſeized by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and Impriſoned: Being told of the Fires heat, <hi>O,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>God's Spirit will cool thoſe Flames; and</hi> I <hi>am ſailing through a boiſterous Sea, but ſhall ſhortly be in Heaven, help me with your Prayers;</hi> and was Burnt, calling upon Jeſus, with his Eyes and Hands lifted up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Frith,</hi> was Priſoner in the Tower, and had many Conflicts with the Biſhops, and at laſt condemned to be Burnt, and delivered over to the Mayor and Sheriffs, and in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> patiently endured the ſame; the Wind blowing away the Fire, made his Death very long; but by God's Grace, he bore it as though he felt no Pain; he much helped <hi>Tindal</hi> in Tranſlating the New Teſtament.</p>

            <p> And thus have I given you, moſt Great and Noble Ladies, a little ſhort brief hint, of a few brave and famous worthy <hi>Engliſh</hi> Martyrs; there are Hundreds more in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Book which you may find, yea, Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more <hi>Engliſh</hi> and others; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhould love the Truth, and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> true Proteſtant Religion for the Truths ſake, yea, and a little for theſe holy Martyrs ſake. And the God of Heaven grant our merciful King may long Live, and ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit never come again.</p>
            <p>For this is the ſum, and ſubſtance of that Stuff we ſhall have, if we loſe the Bible, of which the Gold Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has a Cart-load, which I here give you in a ſcore or two of Lines, as I found it written in a great Book, Tranſlated out of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to a mighty Princeſs, by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight.</p>
            <p>A great Perſon quitting all his fair Poſſeſſion, and giving them to the Church (as 'twas likely) turned Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52502:112"/> Man, which labour brought Sickneſs and Death; at which very inſtant, all the Bells in <hi>Rome</hi> rang out on their own accord, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Pope himſelf. A certain holy Monk, retiring into a Wilderneſs houſe, 70 miles diſtant from any, 14 Years together, had a certain Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, which came to him every day for his Meat, a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.</p>

A holy Prieſt that went into a very Rich Man's Kitchin, where was a great Dinner of Chickens, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and Feaſants in Diſhes, which when the Prieſt ſaw, he bade the Cook uncover the Diſhes, and they preſently became Toads and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>

            <p> A certain Monk ſaw a little Bird in a Cloyſter ſinging very pleaſantly; and hopping out, he follow'd it to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Wood, where the Bird continued ſinging for the ſpace of two or three hours, as he thought; but returning to the Cloyſter again, thinking he had been only a few hours, or half a day at moſt; but being unknown, and ſearching of the Records, he had been abſent from the Covent 300 Years, when he thought he had not been half a day.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Antonius</hi> tells you of an ill Liver that he knew, was afflicted with tedious Sickneſs, earneſtly begged of God to deliver him, who ſent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to tell him, he muſt lie ſo two Years, and then die, and go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; or elſe lie three days in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and from thence go to Heaven, willing him to take his choice. He preſently pitched on Purgatory, and his Soul went ſtrait thither; where he had not been one hour, but the Angel appeared to him there, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52502:113"/> him how he did; and that he was the ſame Angel that brought him the Meſſage from God, about his two years, or three days in Purgatory:</p>
            <p>Ay, but ſaid he, <hi>You are not a good Angel, for I have been here three years, and you told me but two days.</hi> No, <hi>ſaid the Angel,</hi> it is not one hour yet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O pray for me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I may come out, and go to my ſick Bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> which the Angel did, and the man was very glad he got into the world again.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Francis</hi> writes juſt ſuch another Story, and God ſent an Angel to him, to know whether he would lie one day in Purgatory, or one year longer in his Bed; but prayed hard here, and the Angel came and let him out before he had lay'n one hour, and yet he thought his two dayes had been out, ſo great were thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore what a cruel hard hearted thing is it, for People that have money, to let their Friends
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52502:113"/> lie there in Torment, when the Prieſt can ſo eaſily get them out, if they will but pay for it! Ay, and what a deviliſh thing is that of the Pope, to keep them there for money, eſpecially if they be poor!</p>

            <p>A Gentleman of Noble Parentage became a Monk, and went on with that courage and zeal, that at laſt he challenged the Devil, and bade him do his worſt. The Devil appeared, and fought in his own Cell, and made his noſe and mouth bleed; but with the noiſe the reſt of the Monks came in, where he lay as in a trance, but they carried him to his Bed, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almoſt three days without any ſign of life, in which time, by the company of an Angel, who deſcended to a dark obſcure place, and ſaw a man ſitting in a Chair, and certain beautiful Women thruſting Torches in his mouth, drawing them thorough his body again, and many ſtrange things, which frighted the Monk, and he prayed the Angel to tell him what it meant:</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And he,</hi> ſaid the Angel, <hi>that lay on the Gridiron rub'd with Salt, was a cruel Lord to his Tenants.</hi>

            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like Stories be in that Book, which is big and large, but has not a Primer-full of Divinity in it, only a few moral rational things, mixt with theſe kind of Lyes, which they would teach men inſtead of the Scriptures, and the Holy Word of God. And if ſuch kind of Divinity ſhall be Tranſlated and Dedicated to agreat Princeſs, what ſtuff is there in <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and other Countries, for which we may juſtly charge theſe two or three Scriptures againſt them, and a hundred more, were we minded, who are Enemies to the Bible, and the Souls of Men.</p>

            <p> The firſt Scripture is this, <hi>They have forſaken me the Fountain of living Water, and digged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves broken Ciſterns, which can hold no Water,</hi> Jer. 2. 13. That is, they have forſaken the Holy Scriptures, which contain the waters of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort for all thirſty and deſiring Souls after God and Chriſt, and the ſaving knowledge of God and Chriſt in their Souls; and for the broken Ciſterns, that is, the deceitful, lying, crackt, unſound Hiſtory Books, of little Truth or Divinity in them.</p>
            <p>And this is the very ſame which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in the 2d Chapter of the 2d of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ver. 11, 12. where he ſays, <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a Lye.</hi> 'Tis but one Lye, all their whole Religion; that is, one great, entire Lye, congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, linked, maſs'd, and coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by Time, Policy, Covetouſneſs, Deceit and Ignorance.

            <p>ANd now moſt Noble, Great, and Right Honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Gentlewomen, and others: 'Tis not many Weeks, nay, Days, ſince your poor Orator, Supplicant, or Petitioner, was in his own and others apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at the brink of Death, and the Grave; and ſo, many Days together: But God was pleaſed by Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi> my alone Phyſician, to raiſe me up again. And though in my Sickneſs, my Life ſeemed to be flying away like an Eagle in the Air, and the World, and the Things thereof, to be paſſing away as if they had never
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52502:117"/> been, yet, yet, I did ſecretly reſolve (if God ſhould raiſe me up) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or finiſh, this poor little ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled (and yet ſerious) ſhort, brief, and harmleſs Pocket-Book, with the Ladies Letters; which yet I humbly entreat your Noble Ladyſhips to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, and view over and over, in ſome ſerious leiſure Hour; perſuading my ſelf, that though your Breaſts are full of Piety, Virtue, Wiſdom, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Thoughts, yet you may find ſome, if not many brief hints of Truth, Religion, and Virtue, well worth your pious Thoughts, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; for as Eternity is a very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, ſo every Sickneſs that brings one near the Borders of it, or from the Borders of it, ſhould make us very ſerious, and to Speak and Act as thoſe that have been near another World, though not in it. And truly, if I were no more, nor longer to be in this, than juſt to finiſh theſe few Lines, and humbly, on the bended Knee, to preſent them to your Lilly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52502:117"/> Hands, and ſo to lie down and die at your Feet; yet would I ſeriouſly do it in the way of Prayer to your Honours. Firſt, That the ſhort Hints might be weighed, and weighed, again and again, in your moſt ſtrict, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and retired Thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether they be really ſo as they ſeem to be hinted to you; and if you find them indeed ſo to be, by the ſtandard, Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule, Reed, or Touchſtone of God's holy Word; then not to ſlight and ſay, <hi>Piſh Fool;</hi> or cry, <hi>This ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Man will never a done;</hi> for 'tis of more concern than ſo. Truth is Truth, and ſerious Things muſt and will be ſerious, whether we mind or count them ſo or no. And this I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, if ever you come, as come you muſt, to a Fit and Bed of Sickneſs; I mean, a thorow Sickneſs that your life ſeems in your own &amp; others thoughts to be flying away; you will be then thinking of your immortal ever-living and never-dying Souls: And it may be in a dowſed manner not knowing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52502:118"/> well, where you are, or what Day it is; whether Day or Night: The Watch Candle being in the Room, the Curtains drawn, little or no Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſpeak to you, becauſe of the high Feaver, or other Diſtemper, but yet in that hour (it may be) Fears, Doubts, Conſcience will be working, and ſecret Queſtions will be working in you, whether you muſt and ſhall Die, now or no; go to the Grave, leave your golden Hangings, Rooms, Honours, and Relations, going to the ſilent and be ſeen no more, whilſt it may be, are juſt in the middle of ſome great Deſign or other, as your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant was in theſe Papers, or ſetting up of your little Charity-School at <hi>High-Gate:</hi> But be it what it will, every Deſign muſt break off, if Death really come with, and at the end of, your Sickneſs; and then no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of you or yours, will be after a very little while. Oh, Madams, for our Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and your own Souls, I beſeech you mind a little
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52502:118"/> 
               <hi>the houſe of mourning,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 2. which he ſays 'tis ſo good to go to; and the Bed of ſickneſs before it comes, and eſpecially what to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes; that its coming may not be as a damp and death to your ſpirits when it comes. It's ſaid the Cockatrice never kills, but when it ſees us before we ſee it. Oh be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with your Sickneſs, and prepare in Life for Death, and Health for Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! and aſſure your ſelves, you may as well perſuade your ſelves, that <hi>Michaelmas</hi> will never come, becauſe <hi>April</hi> is, and <hi>May</hi> is at hand, as that Sickneſs and Death will not come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Health, Wealth, Honour, and all about you, is now as you would have it; and more comforts ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to you alſo, from a Son or Daughter's great Match or Purchaſe, which you are juſt a making: But yet <hi>Michaelmas</hi> comes in courſe, and Winter too, when one Flower will not be left. But now againſt the height and heart of that, and all that is cold
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52502:119"/> and killing unto Creature-comforts, ſet a never-failing good God aſide; make him your portion, and with the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſay, <hi>Though the labour of the Olive ſhould fail, Flocks, Herds, and the Fruits of the Field yield no increaſe, yet I will rejoyce greatly, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation,</hi> Habbak. 3. 17, 18. But this muſt nor can ever otherwiſe be, but by true Faith in the Love, Life, Blood, Death and Merit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with holy walking in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces of his Spirit, ſix or ſeven of which you may eminently find I ſhall hint at in the firſt Sermon our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ever preach'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Firſt, <hi>bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven;</hi> by purchaſe, purpoſe, promiſe, and eternal preparation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25, 34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, and receive a Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</hi> Oh bleſſed Poverty, that enriches men with the Kingdom of Heaven! This
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52502:119"/> poverty of Spirit is nothing elſe but a ſenſible want of Grace and Chriſt, and every good thing in our ſelves; through the diſcovery of original ſin to us by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby we go out of our ſelves as knowing our ſelves to be loſt, by the purity and ſpirituality of God's moſt holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, piercing Law, the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, by which we go out of our ſelves, as knowing our ſelves to be moſt miſerable, wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and loſt in our ſelves, ſeeing no hope, nor help any ways, but in Gods mercy thorough Chriſt; and this brings us to be like the poor Prodigal or Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. to cry, <hi>Lord be merciful to me poor lost ſinner,</hi> and grant that I may find Chriſt, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for my Soul; and by Prayer, Reading, Hearing, Preaching, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, make out after him in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, perſevering way. And this is the Poverty to which the Kingdom of Heaven belongs, that is the Goſpel with all its Promiſes, and everlaſting
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52502:120"/> Kingdom of Glory too; which God grant you and yours may all find.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that mourn; for they ſhall be comforted:</hi> that is for ſin, in-dwelling of original and actual ſin, and upon that account cry out, like great St. <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin?</hi> Rom. 7. 24. Mark, Ladies, Sin has a Body, yea in <hi>Paul</hi> it had, though he was as great and experienced a Saint and Servant of Chriſt as ever liv'd; that is an in-dwelling in every part of our Body, yea and Soul too, ſaith <hi>Perkins</hi> and Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher.</hi> Indeed both, and every part of both, is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably defiled through <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; and this in-dwelling of ſin in us, makes good men mourn, and hinders them alſo that they cannot do what they would, and makes them too too often do what they ſhould not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. I hope you Ladies and Gentlewomen find it ſo. And this is the true cauſe of their mourning and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52502:120"/> complaining; <hi>But bleſſed are they that mourn,</hi> upon this ſo good and gracious an account, <hi>for they ſhall be comforted;</hi> firſt here, 2dly hereafter; and a thouſand promiſes are made to them in the Holy Writ, <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſaith the Lord. Speak ye comfortably unto</hi> Zion, <hi>her Warfare is accompliſhed, her Victory is ended, her Sins are pardoned,</hi> Iſa. 40. 1, 2. <hi>And bleſſed is the man whoſe ſin is pardoned,</hi> Pſal. 32. 1. This real bleſſedneſs is beyond the tongue of men or Angels to ſet out, and oh that it might be yours, and that you could mourn and ſecretly weep, and now and then on the knee drop a tear in the Cloſet upon this account, that you have lived to your ſelves, your Lords, Pleaſure, Sin and the World ſo much, and Chriſt ſo little! God would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly comfort you with a thouſand ſecret Soul-comforts in the pardon of Sin, the ſenſe of his love and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt to your Souls; and this aſſure your ſelves ſhall be your
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52502:121"/> laſt and laſting comforts, if you be Sin-mourners and Forſakers of it.</p>
            <p>But, Thirdly, <hi>Bleſsed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the Earth,</hi> Mat. 5. 4. Yea, and God too in the Earth: For thus ſaith he that is High and Holy, <hi>I will dwell with him that is of a meek and lowly Spirit,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. May this high and holy One dwell and abide in all your Ladyſhips Hearts, Souls, and Families; may he ſecretly be your Comfort Day and Night, but you muſt be meek; <hi>and I am meek and lowly,</hi> ſays Chriſt. Humility is a great Grace in a great Perſon, and well becomes your moſt Noble Sex, yea, and Lords too; but this Meekneſs is a quiet ſubmiſſiveneſs of Grace in your wills to the Will of God, in all his Providences to you and yours; whereby you ſay as it were with holy <hi>David, If he has pleaſure in me, he will bring me back again.</hi> And with good old <hi>Ely, It is the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 18. And with <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Friends after weeping
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52502:121"/> for him, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done,</hi> Acts 21. 14. And like our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in his Agony, about paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the bitter Cup in his Bloody Agony, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi> This is a brave frame indeed for Ladies on the Knees, to hold up the little Hands, kiſs the Rod qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and patiently ſubmit to all the Providences, Loſſes, and Afflictions, becauſe God as a Father, ſends them for good and holy ends to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, beſt known to himſelf; and if you patiently take them as his Children without Murmuring, then are you Meek, Patient ones indeed. 'Tis the ſturdy Oaks that reſiſt the Winds and are ſplit, but the gentle Reed yields: And ſtubborn Sinners quarrel at the Providence and Will of God, but good Men and Women ſubmit &amp; ſerve ſome divine deſign or other; and this is the way to inherit the Earth. That is to ſay, All your outward Earthly Comforts, namely, Honour, Riches, and Proſperity, yea,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52502:122"/> Heavenly and Inward too. Does God take one Child? Be quiet, leſt he take another. Does he take one part of your Eſtate, or Comfort? He can take another; yea, He can take all, as he did <hi>Job</hi>'s, and reſtore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Bleſſed be his holy Name,</hi> Job 1. 21. Oh! labour to be Meek and lowly, and he will lead and guide you through the Wilderneſs of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, wretched, ſinful, and bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World, in all your plentiful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, till you come to himſelf in Glory.</p>
            <p>But, Fourthly, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs.</hi> What Righteouſneſs? God's, <hi>Chriſt's, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's, Iſaac's, Jacob's, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Faith's Righteouſneſs; and the fruit of this Righteouſneſs is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. By Righteouſneſs here is meant, that which God imputes to Men or Women, and makes Sinners compleat and happy in, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Son's Righteouſneſs, or that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52502:122"/> which is often called his Son's Active and Paſſive Obedience, as God and Man in our Nature, to the whole Will and Law of God. Chriſt, you know, did all the Will of God in a way of Obedience, Submiſſion, and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to his holy Law, and ſo fulfil every Branch of it to a tittle; for had he failed in one, he could never have Juſtified us, who do ſtill come ſhort in all, as we are in our ſelves. But he ſuffered all the Will of God too, in a way of ſatisfaction for our Breach and Breaches of this his holy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Perfect, Good, and Heavenly Law, given by God himſelf unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 20. Yea, as he fulfilled this, and ſatisfied for the Breach of it; ſo he did the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Ceremonial Law alſo; for he was Circumciſed and Baptized for us in both, and all which he ſtood as a Man, or God-Man, and Surety for us, or as one in our Room, Stead, Place, or Company. And as he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd the Law for us in the Active
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52502:123"/> Obedience of his Life, ſo he did all the Law required, or God ever deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him in his Will to do, and in his Death, he ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for all that we, or <hi>Adam</hi> ever did againſt him, or his moſt pure and holy Law. Yea, he did it to the full, uttermoſt, and over too, whereby he has, as it were, an infinite Overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endleſs Merit in his Hand, to ſhew the Juſtice of God in our behalf, why he ſhould deliver us from Hell, and all the Curſe and Curſes of the Law; which dreadful ones, you may read in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 15, 16, 17, 18. which implies Eternal Death to all out of Chriſt; for it ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all that is written;</hi> and not only ſo, but to give us everlaſting Life and Glory. Pray La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, mind this ſeriouſly, for it is this Obedience of Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that, and that alone, which being imputed, reckoned, and conveyed, or given unto us, becomes before God in a way of ſtrict Juſtice
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52502:123"/> and equal Righteouſneſs, our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo eternal Salvation; and you, nor none of you, nor any living, can be ſaved otherwiſe, and therefore well may, and well ought you, for to mind it. And how <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>He was made Sin, and died for us, as well as Born for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. Now this Righteouſneſs is called God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Faith's and the Saints Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 8. And firſt, It is called God's, becauſe God contrived and deſigned this Way of juſtifying Sinners from Eternity; therefore ſays <hi>Paul, God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their Sins,</hi> 2 Cor, 5. 19. Secondly, It is called God's Righteouſneſs, becauſe Chriſt who was God as well as Man, wrought and brought it about; yea, he alone brought it about: And therefore it is ſaid of the People, <hi>There was none to</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:52502:124"/> 
               <hi>help, and mine own arm brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Iſa. 63. 5. Then what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and diſhonour do the <hi>Papiſts</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, in bringing ſo many He and She-Saints in to ſhare with him; now the work's done?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is called <hi>God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, reckoned, implied, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us by the holy Spirit of God, <hi>working Faith in our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then ſecondly, it is frequently called Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, becauſe Chriſt, as man, in our nature, ſtead, room, and place, wrought it for us, not Chriſt and <hi>Peter,</hi> not Chriſt and <hi>Paul;</hi> the Diſciples all ſlept, and Chriſt prayed, and ſweat alone, bore all the wrath, and hung upon the Tree for us; bore our ſins in his own body; dead, buried, and roſe again for us; well may he be called, as he is, <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>the Juſtifier of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is called <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> he being the Father,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52502:124"/> firſt and moſt ancient Saint of God, and he to whom the promiſe, next <hi>Adam,</hi> or rather <hi>Eve,</hi> was moſt eminently made; and therefore ſaith God, <hi>In thy Seed,</hi> that is in Chriſt, <hi>ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22. 17. Not that it is indeed his any more than <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Servant of God's that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promiſe, as he or they emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 1. We are bid <hi>look unto Abraham;</hi> do, and go unto the ſame Pit as he did, namely, Chriſt for Righteouſneſs: (for as God juſtified him, ſo, juſt ſo and no otherwiſe will he do by you, and all us that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is called the <hi>Gentiles Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, the Heathens and Ungodly Sinners, ſuch as were <hi>without God in the World,</hi> and did worſhip inſtead of the true God, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch, Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon; Mars, Venus, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo;</hi> and the Devil in an hundred Idols, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Trees, and Four-footed Creatures.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52502:125"/> Now to theſe miſerable <hi>Gentiles</hi> was Chriſt promiſed and ſent, and he ſhall bring forth judgment unto the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> Iſa. 51. namely <hi>Christ;</hi> that is a right underſtanding to worſhip the true God that made Heaven and Earth, which <hi>Papiſts</hi> yet ſo much continue in, by worſhiping Pictures, Shrines, Images, and the conſecrated Hoſt, a little Half-farthing Wafer; and for which not doing, they have burnt and murthered thouſands. A thing moſt cruel on one hand, and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal on the other; yea more than the <hi>Perſians</hi> worſhiping of the Sun a thouſand times, for that's a glorious creature, though it be but a creature. Now from theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> we came, and are of their Race; yet by Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, which is called the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we are made near, though otherwiſe Strangers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens.</p>
            <p>But fifthly, as it is called <hi>God's, Chriſt's, Abraham's,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo it is called <hi>Faith's</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52502:125"/> 
               <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of Faith might come unto the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 9. 30. And it is called <hi>Faith's Righteouſneſs,</hi> firſt becauſe by Faith we ſee it, lay hold on, and believe in it, to the ſaving of our ſouls. Faith is an eye, that ſees Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. Faith is an hand, and receives Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. Faith is an ear, that hears Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs when 'tis preached on; <hi>And all my Sheep follow me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh,</hi> Joh. 10. 28. <hi>For with the heart man believes,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.</hi> What Confeſſion? namely this, <hi>That God has raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and made his life and death a Righteouſneſs for poor ſinners, which alone is the ground of their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eternal ſalvation in the higheſt Heavens alſo.</hi> And for this, and this alone, and denying Maſs, Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Works of Supererogation, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52502:126"/> for denying the Popes Infallibility and Supremacy, have thouſands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands been maſſacred and murdered in the Chriſtian world; but when did any Proteſtants put any Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks to death, meerly upon the account of their Religion? or how very few have they been? <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was knock'd on the head by 3 or 4 Blades at Court, for quarrelling with the King, or interrupting of the Laws; and ſome-body elſe by a juſt Law hang'd, for a Gun intended againſt a better &amp; much greater King; and for this one is Sainted, and the other may be too in a little time: But Faith and its Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs teaches us none of theſe, but <hi>to ſubmit to Kings, and all lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that we may live peaceably and quietly under them in all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and honeſty,</hi> Rom. 13. 1.</p>
            <p>But ſixthly, this Righteouſneſs is called the <hi>Saints Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, all ſanctified men, women and children, and Righteouſneſs in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52502:126"/> world; for a Saint is nothing elſe in a ſtrict ſenſe, but a man or woman tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearing God; and a little of the true fear and grace of God in the heart, makes any man or woman in the world ſo in the account of God and the holy Scriptures; for 'tis not No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Gifts, Parts, great and humane Learning, but ſaving truth that make a Saint. <hi>And all the humane learning in the world,</hi> ſays <hi>Hintius, will not rectifie the crooked nature of man;</hi> as inſtance <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the one being a covetous wretch as ever liv'd, and the other keeping a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Strumpet for his Luſt. But a little ſaving grace will bridle men from all ſin, when bare humane knowledge cannot; nor all the Braſs, Tin and Copper in the world, make a dram of Gold; nor all the common gifts, parts and wit of men, which I ſpeak not in the leaſt againſt, no not in the leaſt, but reverence it, and them that have it; yet, I ſay, 'tis grace, and the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace and Spirit of God in the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52502:127"/> heart that makes a Saint, and whoever has any thing of that more or leſs; for ſome have much more and ſome much leſs than others, yet whoever has the leaſt ſanctifying meaſure of the Truth in his Heart, is a Saint and Servant of God, be he Noble or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, High or Low, Rich or Poor, Learned or Unlearned; and for this, ſee theſe Texts, or Scriptures at your leiſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2, 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <p>And therefore if any fine young Lady, Gentlewoman, or others, have but a little love to Chriſt, the Word, Ways, Things, or Servants of Chriſt, ſhe may be a Saint as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; they were called at the firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Brethren, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2. Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. Saints and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. And we are now lately called Proteſtants, from the ſeven Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> proteſting againſt the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, but are indeed the true real Catholicks, becauſe we hold the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52502:127"/> truths which were from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, are, and ſhall be ſo to the Worlds end; the main of which, is the Worſhipping of God in and through Chriſt, and loving Him and his Son for ever. But many beyond Sea are called <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> for following thoſe great Lights and their Doctrine. But now this Righteouſneſs of God, Chriſt, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jews, Gentiles,</hi> and Believers is called the Saints, for two or three Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe it is this that makes them ſo. Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is our Juſtification, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation too before God, and it is that and his holy Spirit ſanctifying of us, which makes us Saints in the Eyes of God, and before Men in this World too; take three diſtinctions, and they will end 20 diſputes about this Point, <note place="margin">☜</note> for Chriſt juſtifies us before God by his Blood, Life, and Death. Faith, that is the object of Faith; Chriſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies us in our own Conſciences, ſo that it is not ſo much Faith in a ſtrict
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52502:128"/> ſenſe, as Chriſt by Faith Juſtifies us and that too. And indeed, Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imperfect at the beſt, needs a Chriſt for Juſtification, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces, though it ſtill ſhews us Chriſt as in a glaſs, for our juſtification, and good Works which are really ſo, and the fruits of God's Spirit, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good Works, theſe do juſtifie us before Men: <hi>And therefore</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>let your light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 16. And ſays St. <hi>James, Shew me thy Faith by thy Works, and do not tell me ſo much thou haſt it, but let me ſee it by thy Works.</hi> So that to God we muſt plead the Blood of Chriſt, and nothing elſe, and to our Conſciences, ſhew the Blood of Chriſt, and witneſs all to others by good Works and a Godly Converſation; and this is the Saints viſible and inviſible Juſtification.</p>
            <p>And now, had I the Tongue of Men, or Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. I could
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52502:128"/> never enough ſet out the Bleſſedneſs, or Bleſſedneſſes of Men or Women, that do Hunger and Thirſt, that is, Long, Love, and ſecretly wiſh and pray for day by day this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to be found in it, namely, this of God and Chriſt, and the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying graces of his Spirit, for they ſhall be ſatisfied, yea, they ſhall certainly be ſatisfied in the diſcovery of it, and preſent comfort alſo; yea, in the everlaſting wearing and enjoyment of it in the higheſt Heavens. For as Kings Cloath all their Yeomen in their Gold Embroidered Coats. So Chriſt the King of Kings, doth ſpiritually Cloath the Souls of all his; and by vertue of this, <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the Sun, in the Kingdom of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for evermore,</hi> Mat. 13 43. Yea, all his Rich, and all his Poor, and all his Gifted, and all his Ungifted, that hunger after it. Here one has his Silken Suit, and another his Thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Habit; here one has their Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Shifts, and fine Laces, others
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52502:129"/> want courſe Linnen; but Time ſhall paſs, and Time ſhall come, when all wants ſhall be done away, and ſmall Gifts, and no Gifts ſcarce, ſhall be equally happy with the greateſt, for all ſhall everlaſtingly ſhine as the Sun in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; which is the Bleſſedneſs here hunger'd after, which is the White Linnen, and the Wedding Garment, ſo often ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Rev. 19. 8. And that which <hi>Paul</hi> would ſo feign be found in; <hi>Counting his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs but dung and droſs, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it,</hi> Phil. 3. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>But, Fifthly, Our Lord and Saviour goes ſtill on with his Bleſſings, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Bleſsed are the Merciful, for they ſhall obtain Mercy,</hi> Mat. 5. 7. <hi>And the merciful Man, will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his Beaſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And now, Noble Ladies, give me leave to plead with you a little, from this good Text, <hi>The Mercies of God are dear and tender Things, the choiceſt chiefeſt things in Heaven and</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:52502:129"/> 
               <hi>Earth.</hi> We have nothing to hang upon Living, or Dying, but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies of God in Chriſt, which he proclaims, and ſhews to us, <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 26. And he was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſhewed mercy in the Pit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 17. And, <hi>A merciful Man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) doth good to his own Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you will ſhew a little to ſome 30 or near 40 poor and fatherleſs Boys now in your School at <hi>Highgate, you will ſhine as lights before men, and your candle ſhall be on a hill, and not under a buſhel,</hi> which Chriſt bids you do; and in doing of it, do good to your own, ſo ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 11. 17. and in this, and doing ſomething for it, you will to yours.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>You have ways e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and need not a new deſign for Charity:</hi> Oh! but you can never have too many ways, nor do too much good in the world; and if it be new, 'tis the more pity that ſo many brave Noble <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies as there be that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52502:130"/> the true Religion, and are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious alſo; that they have not done ſome publick thing for the honour of it, as well as old <hi>Sutton,</hi> when you ſee ſo many burnt to aſhes for the Goſpel, and that Religion which you profeſs. Oh then do a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eminent, and ſomething that may have a little notice taken of it, for the honor of their Lord &amp; Maſter, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and your own alſo! all which this would do; ſurely the great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hoſpitals of <hi>London</hi> are famours praiſe-worthy things, and honourable to Religion; and ſhould nor you moſt Great and Noble <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, which all the world muſt needs give place unto, do ſomething for the honour of it? If they did well that did build, and ſet up them, as you will not ſay but they did, you cannot do amiſs in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle countenancing this. Thoſe were done by ſome one particular perſon at firſt, which would ſwallow up a great and whole Eſtate; this would hurt no more than a little Tradeſmans
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52502:130"/> Bill, becauſe there are ſo many of you to join in this good and pious Work; ſurely God will incline ſome of your hearts, yea many, we yet hope, to it. The Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>You will do good to your own Souls.</hi> And we are certain it can be no hurt to your children; come and take Chriſt's counſel, and <hi>lay up treaſure in Heaven, where no Rust nor Moth, nor Thief can ever come; and to the merciful, God will ſhew himſelf merciful.</hi> But if you do not love your Souls, care for treaſure in Heaven, nor the tender mercies, which is the Riſe, Spring-head and Fountain of all we hope for, or can hope for from God in this world, or t'other, you need not mind theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this bleſſed Book of his. Oh! but you dare not ſay or think ſo in the leaſt; for God and his mercies are your laſt and laſting Refuges. Oh! then dear good Ladies, Gentlewomen, and others, as the <hi>Italian</hi> Beggars proudly beg, ſaying frequently, <hi>Do it for your own good.</hi> Let us humbly beg
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52502:131"/> as on our knee, in the bowels of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, do, yea, and do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your lame Objections, <hi>That you have ſo many ways,</hi> when it is nothing elſe but a will and heart that you want; for you have Purſe enough, and 20 ways to ſave a little, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ſomething worthy of this good Deſign. And you may be ſure 'tis a good one, becauſe it is to feed, cloath and teach poor ignorant Children to know themſelves, fear God, and live in a hard world, what can be better? ask your Lords; I am ſure the Lord Chriſt, all the Prophets and Apoſtles commend it; <hi>I have cloathed the hungry,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> And <hi>Dorcas</hi> or <hi>Lydia made cloaths,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9. 39. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a man full <hi>of good Works, Almſ-deeds, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Acts 10. 4. And Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſold their Lands to give to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated Brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32, 3, 4. ſo that 'twas all along, and is ſtill a good work, becauſe it ſuits ſo well with our Religion, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:52502:131"/> which ſaith with St. <hi>James, Faith without Works is dead,</hi> Jam. 2. 26. But this, and ſuch as the nature of this is, amongſt many others will declare it living.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is a good work, becauſe it will in ſome meaſure ſtop the mouths of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who are prone to ſay, Where are your Works, and how few are your Hoſpitals, and how ſmall is your Charity, notwithſtanding great Preaching? Yet we have more than they know, but do not boaſt as they do. Our Catholick Doctrine teaches us to do good, private and publick too: And this is a Catholick grace, becauſe it is more or leſs in every Member of Chriſt; and ought ſo to be, for he bids us <hi>be merciful, as our heavenly Father is merciful, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Sun to ſhine, and the Rain to rain upon the just, and the unjuſt,</hi> Mat. 5. 45. I ſhall give you one bleſſed Scripture more, and I hope I may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any boaſting, truly ſay, I have even this preſent <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſomething of it; and God
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52502:132"/> Almighty grant that you, many, or all of you, might do ſo too; for it will be your caſe or caſes, as ſure as God lives, to lie upon the Bed of Sickneſs, as I have done many days together: Now ſays the Holy Writ, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that conſidereth the poor and needy,</hi> Pſal. 41. 1.</p>
            <p>All theſe Children of <hi>Hampſtead, Hornſey,</hi> or <hi>Highgate,</hi> are really ſo; the <hi>Lord preſerveth and keepeth him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth him not into the hands of his Enemy, and keepeth him alive, the Lord ſhall comfort him when he is ſick upon his Bed, and ſhall make his Bed in his ſickneſs;</hi> that is, comforts for his Soul, yea and Body too; if this great, full, plain, eminent, well-known Scripture be not conſidered, none will.</p>
            <p>Now 'twill be of the lateſt, may be, another day; and you will certainly come to be ſick, and it may be in your Sickneſs be dozed, ſcarce know where it be day or night, as I ſaid before, and it may be in your Sickneſs have many fears and doubts concerning
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52502:132"/> your eternal weal. The Enemy will tempt you, by reaſon of ſin and guilt, ſecretly to deſpair, or throw away your Soul and Souls; nay he will do it, becauſe you have liv'd no more to God and his Honour, but have minded your own Honour, Eaſe, Pleaſure, and Intereſt, in the World, done no Good, been a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in Name, only having a form of Godlineſs, but no Power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. And a thouſand things of this Nature he will bring, it may be, he will bring ſome particular Sins committed ſo and ſo to your Minds, whilſt the Room is cloſe, or two or three in it, with a watch Light, the Curtains drawn, but the Evil One is very buſie in the Bed or Conſcience with you. Now, now, if you wiſh (as God Almighty grant you may) never be delivered over into your Enemies, or the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankinds ſalvations Hands. Mind this Promiſe: I do not bid you build upon it; that is dangerous: But build upon Chriſt, and mind this, for the Promiſes muſt be minded, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52502:133"/> the Conditions performed too in ſome meaſure: And therefore be Merciful, that the Lord may be Pitiful, and not by Death deliver you to your Enemies Hands. 'Tis a dreadful ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing, for a poor Partridge to lie trembling in the Talons of the Faulcon, ſays the <hi>Practice of Piety;</hi> but a thouſand thouſand times more dreadful to be delivered into the hands of Satan, in a dying Hour; but the Promiſe is, <hi>God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the merciful Man into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands,</hi> Pſal. 41. 2. <hi>but keep him alive:</hi> Nay, he will certainly do it, that is, He will keep him alive in Chriſt, unto Eternal Life, or elſe alive in this World for more Work and Comfort; which latter Promiſe is rather meant here. So that a long Life ſeems to be promiſed to a merciful Man or Woman. And now, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, would you alſo live long on the Earth, as I believe you would? and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all your Comforts, Riches, Honors, and Relations, be merciful to the Poor, not idle vagabons, ſturdy Rogues
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52502:133"/> and Beggars, that make a Trade; but poor induſtrious Houſe-keepers, old people and children, that are paſt their Labour, or too young, poor Outed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Widows, and others: All theſe you muſt conſider. And as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Do good unto all men, as ye have opportunity, eſpecially the houſhold of Faith;</hi> and in ſo doing you might expect the promiſe or promiſes. But ſome may object, it may be you would have us give all away; no, nor above the tenth part neither, ſcarce that: Yet many, many good men and Miniſters think we are bound to that; eſpecially Dr. <hi>Gouge.</hi> And in his Book called <hi>The Beſt Way of Thriving,</hi> gives you forty Arguments of Scripture for it: And tells you an excellent ſtory of a Biſhop, that loſt a hundred pound for not giving five, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Divine diſcretion muſt be uſed, for this and the other world too. We all commend good Husbandry, and good Houſwifery. But what think you of the Lady <hi>Warwick?</hi> ſhe would
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52502:134"/> ſay, <hi>Save the money of one Rich Lac'd Gown a year, and that would ſerve to cloath a great many poor Children, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it ſhould be a</hi> May-Gown: Here was good Houſwifery, and great Charity. <hi>I had rather ſtarve a Luſt,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>than not feed a good Chriſtian.</hi> And ſhe found the comfort of it in her ſickneſs, for ſhe had ſcarce any: God toll'd her Soul away, as it were, without groans. But you, it may be, let a thouſand pound Necklace, it may be more, lie dead in a little penny Bran Box; and many thouſands more in Jewels, Plate, Gold, or Silver by you; and yet, yet, think it a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do a little, any thing that is for a Noble, Good and Brave Charitable Deſign, which may flouriſh to the world's end, for ought you know. If you would do ſome little thing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, take no care for hereafter; as our Saviour ſayes of to morrow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 22. There are Ladies enough in <hi>England;</hi> yea, and good Citizens too, for to carry it on, when you have once ſet it up.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:52502:134"/>
            <p> But I have heard that a poor Coach-maker's Wife gave almoſt as much as a great Counteſs, at a Collection: Will this paſs? Nay, do you your ſelves think this will in the day of Account? And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will take an Account of every Lady of the Land, Wife or Widow, as well as others. And though he approved of the poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's Mite caſt into the Treaſure; yet he will never accept of your Charity, except it be in ſome meaſure propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Talent he has put in your hands: For, do you think that God or Chriſt will accept of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of one Talent from a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Lord or others, that he has given ten to? no, he will ask you, <hi>Where are the other nine?</hi> and you will then be ſpeechleſs: For he does not allow you, nor no man living, to lay up, up, out and out for Self, Covetouſneſs, Honour, Pride, Vain-Glory, Children, Grand-children, Nephews, Nieces, and all manner of Relations; this and that great purchaſe every year; but ſtill
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52502:135"/> little or nothing for Religion, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, God, or your Souls; but for Silk, Sattin, Coaches, Lace, Tire-women, and other French Toys; and yet may be you good Ladies too; all which we grudge you not in the leaſt; but in the mean time, to ſee you all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſlight Charity, the love and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent practice of it; this is uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not Lady <hi>Vere</hi> like: Or will ſhe and you ſtand alike together in the day of Accounts? Nay, will not the Lady <hi>Drummond,</hi> though a Papiſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſome of you? She was not of the true Church, and yet gave almoſt a thouſand pound to the Poor; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a Funeral. Come, come, be convinced, and do more good while you live; for you have not done a quarter of that good you might have done, and not have hurt your Lords Eſtates, or run backwards in the leaſt; nor do we in the leaſt deſire that you ſhould: <hi>For Charity brings a great bleſſing;</hi> as a good Divine ſaid. But you want a heart or a hand for Chriſt,

As a Merchant did about Wooll; and would hear nothing but what price Wooll bore: <hi>Bring my Manteau, and my green Petticoat; I will riſe; but the Watchers cry, Pray good Madam be ſtill, and keep your Arms in the Bed: Don't tell me; I will riſe and go ſee my Lady ſuch a one; call the Coach quickly:</hi> And a hundred things run in the head, when we are running to another world, and its Eternity may be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared: Now if you would find mercy in that day, which was the laſt Text that worthy Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> ever Preacht on; will it not be very ſweet, welcom and ſeaſonable, when all things, creature comforts and relations
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52502:136"/> are juſt a going from you, or you from them for ever, to find a God embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of you? Oh! be good then; do good; and remember the Poor; and this good Work too, becauſe it may live when you are gone; flouriſh and be a mighty Tree, as I ſaid before: but the promiſe is, You ſhall rather live too, and not dye; For the Lord will keep him alive when he lies ſick: Mark that word; and it may be when you are dangerouſly ſick, and in your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, you would not for half; nay, all your Eſtates but that you ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; becauſe you have doubts and fears about your Soul's Eternal ſtate, as the poor Apothecary had, that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſpairingly, <hi>He ſhould go to Hell, and lye millions of years there.</hi> But now to be kept alive and recover, will be the ſweeteſt and greateſt mercy to you in the world. Oh try! truſt, and take God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s promiſe before all the world's: <hi>They often fail, though the blood of Chriſt never,</hi> as one ſaid when his head was going off.

'tis but, venture a little mony; it may be 'tis no more, not ſo much as a French Page, or one or two Liveries coſt you, or ſome leſſer thing, if you look well about.

The Ladies, not what Ladies; but the Ladies, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all by that general, univerſal, endleſs name, as it were, though it be intended to pious, good and great Religious Proteſtant Ladies, and other virtuous Gentlewomen; yet it has an univerſal name, becauſe no body knows what God may incline ſome, or how many of that Noble Sex to do for it. Some are apt to think it may be in time as big as moſt things (why not?) and as worthy; it bears ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noble names, as there be Ladies in the Land, or ſhall be ſucceſſively; and who knows but ſome body may dye, want an Heir; and remember this, when you have ſet it once a little up: For it is ſtill <hi>The Ladies Charity School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52502:138"/> of the world, when the Soul is ſtepping upon the dark Mountains of Eternity, or ſitting on the Lip, juſt taking wing; with the laſt gaſp to fly away for ever, as an Eagle in the Air? O mercy, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then! and in that day may mercy be your portion. And as the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Hadly</hi> wept and prayed for Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in the ſtreet, as he was going to be burnt, ſaying, <hi>Oh! Lord Jeſus Chriſt; relieve thee our good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> as you have relieved and comforted us many times with your Charity. But there are two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes more, which I ſhall hint at and I have done. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God, Matt.</hi> 5. 8. To ſee God is the very heaven of heavens, and to ſee him in heaven is the laſt and laſting higheſt happineſs of all men, angels, and glorified crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or whatſoever our ſoul or ſouls can, or ſhall ever to all eternity deſire: and may you and all you ſo ſee him and perſonally enjoy him for ever and ever: but there muſt be purity,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52502:138"/> and heart purity, for it is the pure in heart that ſhall ſee him in glory, <hi>without holineſs no man can ſee him, Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>And with the pure he will ſhew himſelf pure, Pſal.</hi> 18. 26. but in a ſtrict ſenſe this word pure muſt not be taken, as if in a ſtrict ſenſe we ſhould not ſee him without perfect holineſs in our ſelves which is to be without all ſin, and to be perfectly holy in his ſight, which otherwiſe than in Chriſt no man living can be; ſaith <hi>Job, The Stars are not pure in his ſight, Job</hi> 25. 5. <hi>and he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held folly in his Angels, Job</hi> 4. 17. much leſs men, the beſt of men, or the beſt of their actions, yea, <hi>ſo none can ſay I am pure, Prov.</hi> 20. 9. but men may be ſaid to be pure as they are waſhed, juſtified, ſanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and made pure by the blood of Chriſt, and ſo every believer, or juſtified, ſanctified perſon is pure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Timothy</hi> ſpeaks of a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that is waſhed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. ſerving God with a pure
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52502:139"/> conſcience. And ſo again <hi>Paul</hi> bids us draw near to God with a true heart and full aſſurance (of what?) faith in Chriſt for juſtification, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience with the blood of Chriſt, and our bodies waſht with pure water, that is, the water of ſanctification by his ſpirit, typified by that which came out of his bleſſed ſide when by the ſpear pierced for us upon the Croſs. And thus, noble Ladies, it is that you muſt be pure if ever you will be pure, and ſee God in Glory, you muſt be waſhed by the blood of Chriſt, and ſanctified by the ſpirit of Chriſt, fine Words, fine Cloaths, Complements, and Faces doe nothing in point of juſtification; no nor many ſermons hearing if reſted upon, nor other good deeds; no, 'tis the blood of Chriſt witneſſed by an honeſt, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, godly converſation from the integrity of your hearts, that muſt get you the denomination of being
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52502:139"/> pure in heart, and ſeeing God in glory: and therefore dear Ladies, Gentlewomen and others, as ever you would ſee glory, or ſee the face of God in glory, be holy, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mind things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. 2. where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13. and think not that a little little ſlight religion, no religion, any religion will bring you there when nothing will do it without Purity, Strictneſs, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, there muſt be a little of all this; do you think to go in fine Sedans, Down Beds, and Coaches? no, no, it muſt be in a way of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to ſin, and love to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs if you will ever have happineſs; yea, this unſpeakable happineſs of ſeeing God in glory, which one ſaies <hi>He would for one glimps of it endure a great while in hell.</hi> Oh! but you need not go to hell for heaven; for if you go there you will never come out, though the Papiſts fancy they may from Purgatory for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52502:140"/> to the Prieſt: And therefore one ſaid, <hi>Oh Money Money! what wilt not thou do in the Court of Rome! Ay,</hi> ſaid the Pope, <hi>and you are fools to bring it here,</hi> to an <hi>Engliſh man</hi> that was there upon trial for a Church Living. Oh! but go to Chriſt and the promiſe, go to God by Chriſt through the promiſe, beg and plead that you may ſee him, and you ſhall ſee him, and his grace, and hereafter you ſhall ſee his face alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>And his name ſhall be in your foreheads;</hi> that is the bleſſed rayes of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be viſible on you when you come to ſtand before God and the Lamb in glory with your Palmes in your hands, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
            <p>But, ſeventhly and laſtly <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God, Matt.</hi> 7. 9. Peace makers are Chriſt's imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who is called the Peace-maker and the Lord of life and glory, the mighty God the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. by
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52502:140"/> whoſe commiſſion alone it is, that all his Meſſengers and Miniſters do preach Peace and Pardon to poor ſinners, ſuch as are far off and ſuch as are near in their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Yea, to all that believe, be they far or near, Jews or Gentiles, the blood of Chriſt ſpeaks peace and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to them than the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> that cryed for vengeance; and all innocent blood will do ſo. And therefore 'tis not good to pardon any that kill men in quarrels, duels; but this cryes for peace, pardon, and forgiveneſs, <hi>Oh! Father forgive them they know not what they do, Luk.</hi> 23. 34. now to be a peace-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is to be a ſin-reconciler, I do not mean to God, for that none can do but Chriſt who is our propitation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. 4. 10. and he hath done it for all that do believe, but to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>concile men to men is to do all the offices of love and good will, yea, all the offices of good we can for the Church and people of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52502:141"/> in our own place, way, and calling; wiſhing proſperity, peace, and weal, and to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Peace be with thee, and let them proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that love thee, Pſalm</hi> 22. 6, 7. <hi>Peace be within thy walls and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity within thy Palaces, Pſal.</hi> 26. Pray for the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and in the Churches peace, ſhall you have peace ſaith the ſame Prophet, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are ſaid to delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in abundance of peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 11. Where the meek are ſaid again to inherit the earth: And as <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſalutation, ſaid, <hi>Grace be unto you, and Peace, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Col.</hi> 1. 2. And <hi>In as much as in you lies, live peaceably with all men, Rom.</hi> 12. 18. Now firſt there is a perſonal or particular peace, that is, a peace with a man's own ſelf, Mind, Actions, Waies and Conſcience. Secondly, There is a domeſtick peace, that is, with Maſters, Servants, Husbands, Wife and Children. And thirdly,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52502:141"/> There is a Relative Neighbour, or Parochial Peace, that is, one Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Friend or Relation with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And <hi>Moſes</hi> reproved the two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for quarrelling, ſaying, <hi>They were Brethren, Exod.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Oh! how good is it,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>for</hi> natural or ſpiritual) <hi>Brethren to live together in Amity! Pſal.</hi> 133. 1. Fourthly, There is a National and Eccleſiaſtical Peace, which we are to pray for, and deſire alſo: But this is rather to be deſired, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. While ſome men know more, and others leſs, there will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and ſome differences; for all men have not the ſame fancies, nor Phyſiognomies, but do differ there, and in mind too. However, for peace and quiet ſake, let the ſtrong comply with the weak, and the weak not to deſpiſe and judge the ſtrong, becauſe they know more than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And this is to become all to all men, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, to gain ſome: And for God, Chriſt, Peace and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52502:142"/> ſake, do you do ſo; which was the Song that millions of them ſung at the Nativity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to the Shepherds; yea, the univerſal world, ſaying, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, Luk.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Peace and good will towards men on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for your worldly outward Peace, take <hi>Paul</hi> and Chriſt's counſel in a word, and ſo ſhall you preſerve and keep it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Wrong no man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Forgive your Enemies,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. which two Scriptures well obſerved, would make a great deal of peace in the world; eſpecially amongſt the beſt of good Chriſtians. But I ſhall not mind nor trouble you further in any thing of this nature about Peace above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; only this; A perſonal inward Peace, which is a thing of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for Eternity; namely, your Soul-Peace; and for that take this great Scripture, Simile or Parable of our
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52502:142"/> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 56. <hi>Agree with thine Adverſary quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whilſt thou art in the way with him, leſt at any time thy Adverſary deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be caſt into priſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, Thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, never, never.</p>
            <p>And now pray will you mind this, young Ladies and Gentlewomen; for you, for the moſt part, are moſt ignorant of the holy Scriptures, and their meaning.</p>
            <p>This is a true and great Parable of Soul concern; and therefore Chriſt's counſel is ſerouſly to be minded by us.</p>
            <p>Our Adverſary is God; and God, though he be the God of all Good, Grace, Glory, Eternal Love, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Endleſs Mercy; yet he is an
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52502:143"/> Adverſary to every Man, and every Man and Woman by nature too, is an Adverſary, an enemy at diſtance to him, till he be reconciled by Chriſt, for the breach of his moſt righteous, juſt and equal holy Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 19.</p>
            <p>Every branch of which, as it contains a beam of his eternal will and image, is more pure than the Sun, or gold tryed in the Fire, as the Pſalmiſt hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 72.</p>
            <p>Now, whil'ſt ſweet life, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed Goſpel is continued and preach'd to us, we are in the way, in the right way, that we may be reconciled to this good God, who is yet an Enemy, and will continue ſo, if we do not agree and make peace in the blood of Chriſt: But he, namely God, delivers us by death, any kind of death that kills us; Conſumption, Surfeit, Cold, Ague, Feaver, Small-Pox, Age, Gout or Dropſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that we be put into the Judges hands, namely, the good Lord Jeſus Chriſt's,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52502:143"/> who is and ſhall be Judge of quick and dead; he finds us guilty of debt, ſin, unbelief, and breach of God's holy Law; ſends us, and delivers us over into the Jaylors hands, the Devil; and he preſently caſts and carries us to Hell, where we never come out, nor can, till we pay the uttermoſt farthing; that is, till we ſatisfie to the uttermoſt for God's wrong, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſtrict Juſtice, for the breach of his holy, righteous, juſt and good Law; which can never, never be, though we lie millions, millions, and ten thouſand millions of years; as <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Spira</hi> once ſaid. Oh Lords, Ladies, Gentlewomen and other poor People! make Peace while you may; make Peace, yea, whilſt Chriſt and the holy Spirit of Chriſt ſweetly knocks, with an Olive branch of Peace, pleading with you at the door of your hearts. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> that is, by good motions; <hi>and if any one hear, and open the door,</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:52502:144"/> that is, <hi>hearken to my counſel, I will come in and ſup with him,</hi> that is, give him pardon and comfort, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. And ſo again, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Open, Open unto me, my Love, my Dove, and come away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, if you have taken his advice, and have made your Peace, by hearkening unto Chriſt, and taken his counſel, who is an Advocate, Friend and Counſellor, to plead for you to the Father, by ſhewing of his Blood, Death and Merit in a way of Interceſſion to the Father for poor Sinners, then will he be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to you, and not a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judge, to turn you over by Death to Hell and the Jaylor; but will convey you ſafely by the holy Angels, who are now your Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to the Boſom of the Father. And now, if you have made your Peace, as eaſily yet you may, if you have not, and do but look about you with a grain of Faith, through
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52502:144"/> the Blood, Life, Death and Merit of Jeſus Chriſt, as I ſaid before; then you have little elſe to do, but to ſtudy all kind of Peace in your Families, Pariſh-Church, and every where, where you can come or go; <hi>That ye may be called the Children of the Living God, Rom.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>The Sons and Daughters of the moſt High God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1. And ſo Peace-makers indeed. And this frame of ſpirit, with the Spirit of God in you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. will be a great Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Comfort to you, that you are now the Children of God; <hi>and if Children, then Heirs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>and ſo Joynt-heirs with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O unſpeakable Love and Grace! What! an Heir with Chriſt? Ay ſayes the Text, a Joynt-heir with him; of what? nay, that's for Eternity to tell; but this we may ſay they are Heirs of: Firſt, of Eternal Life and Reſurrection from the Dead,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52502:145"/> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 20: 36. But they which ſhall be accounted worthy of that world, namely, Heaven, and the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Dead, neither marry, nor are given in Marriage; neither can they dye any more, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 36. for they are equal to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and are the Children of God, being Children of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Mark, the Children of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, are the Children of God, that is, thoſe, and all thoſe Chriſt roſe as a Head for; they, and all they have a part in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>Bleſſed and happy are they that have part in the firſt Reſurrection; for on ſuch the ſecond Death ſhall have no power;</hi> that is, Hell, the Devil or Jaylors, Priſon, above mentioned.</p>
            <p>O Ladies! Look to Chriſt, who is the firſt Reſurrection, and the firſt begotten from the Dead; and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52502:145"/> for he has loved you, and waſht you from your ſins in his own Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>Yea, look to him that he be your Reſurrection; and that you have a part by Faith in him, who is the true Book of Life, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 27. And if by Faith in him, you riſe from the Grave and Death of ſin here, then may you aſſure your ſelves of a ſhare and part in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection unto Eternal Life, which was typified by the Firſt Fruits, and the Sheaf of Corn which the Prieſt held up and wav'd under the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial or Levitical Law.</p>
            <p>And that you are indeed the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of it, And of God too, and ſo ſhall never dye: Oh! believeſt thou this? as Chriſt ſaid in another place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Lazarus, I am the life and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, and he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me ſhall never dye; Joh.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Yea, though he were dead yet ſhall he live again; Believeſt thou</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:52502:146"/> 
               <hi>this</hi> ſayes Chriſt; ſo ſay I to you noble Ladies, Gentlewomen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers if you be the Children of God and the reſurrection, you ſhall dye no more, dye once you muſt to this world and the things, ſleep a little in the grave, and imitate Chriſt your Head and your Husband, your Lord and your Saviour who was there before you three dayes and three nights; and then deſtroyed and tore the grave open to aſſure you of the reſurrection alſo; but in that you ſhall never dye more: Oh! happy reſurrection when Chriſt ſhall ſay, awake, and ſing O ye that ſleep in the duſt, and with my dead body ſhall ye awake; <hi>Iſaiah Come with me my love from Bebon the Leopard, and the Lions den, Canticles.</hi> All which promiſes, and a thouſand more are made to you if you be the children of God, and peace-makers in the Church, or World, or where you are.</p>

Oh! how glorious is that, this is but the Tileing we ſee, Gods houſe is all inviſible, and the inſide no mortal man nor eye can ſee, nor him neither and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>

            <p>Oh! ye Lords, Ladies, Princes, Kings, Queens, Potentates, and higheſt Mortal of the earth, joyn ye, for it becomes you well, and all ye with that kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> in his three laſt Pſalmes 148, 149, 150. and with this I ſhall cloſe this little little book of yours which was made a little before, and juſt after a great ſickneſs, but the work is Praiſe the Lord from the heaven, Praiſe him in the higheſt, for the higheſt is too low for him. Praiſe him all ye Angels; an Angelical praiſe becomes him and them very well, praiſe him all ye hoſt, be ye what he will, praiſe him Sun and Moon for ye are man and wife to rule both day and night, and he made you both; praiſe him all ye Stars of light, which are as Sun and Moons children, and are of

            <p>Praiſe him Dragons, and deep fiery Mountains, Hail, Snow, and Storms, and fulfil his word; Mountains, Hills, Trees, and Cedars, high Men, and low Men, little Beaſts, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Creeping things, and Flying, little Ants, and mighty Eagles, Kings, Judges, Princes, and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, young Lords, and mayden La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of nine, ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen; let them praiſe his name, for his name alone is excellent,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52502:149"/> and before him let all fleſh be for ever ſilent. His glory is above the Heavens, ever was, is, and ever ſhall be; he alſo exalteth the horn of his people, Chriſt the horn of <hi>David,</hi> and the horn and ſalvation of the Church, as well as the praiſe of all his Saints, Male, and Female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo are <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> all Nations having drunk of his Blood, and Saints too, even the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near unto himſelf, yea, as the apple of his eye. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, ſing a Song of Praiſe,</hi> Pſalm 149. and rejoyce in your King; the Lord reigns, the Lord is King for ever and ever; let the Earth be glad; let them praiſe his Name in Dances, ſpiritual ones, with Timbrel and Harp, joy and comfort in their Souls; for the Lord taketh pleaſure in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſhall a Worm do it in his hole? a Bird in the Sun? a Saint in God?
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:52502:149"/> and not God in his people? Oh yes! he taketh pleaſure in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and will beautifie the meek with ſalvation.</p>
            <p>We told you the meek ſhould inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the earth a little before, but here is heaven and ſalvation too; Oh! Bleſſed are the meek, and bleſſed are all theſe bleſſed ones whom he takes pleaſure in.</p>
            <p>Let the Saints be joyful in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry let them ſing upon their beds, go in all the divine and heavenly diſcoveries, of Gods love to their ſouls; and let a ſword be in their hands, the holy word of God which is as a two edged one to cut down all ungodly luſts and reigning ſins in their ſouls, yea, let the law of God as a golden chain bind their unruly Kingly luſts and Lordly ones too, from act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God and their ſouls, for ever; and to execute on them the doom, that is, death and mortification as St.
